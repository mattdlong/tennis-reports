## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Cocciaretto wins) | P(Ruzic wins) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 5% | 8% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 18% | 24% |
| 6-4 | 12% | 14% |
| 7-5 | 6% | 7% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 6% |

**Analysis:** Based on moderate hold rates (67-73%) for both players, expect frequent service breaks leading to 6-3/6-4 type sets rather than tiebreaks. Ruzic's slightly lower hold rate is offset by her better head-to-head record and current form.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 62% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 38% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 18% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 4% |

**Rationale:** Both players have dominated at Hobart in straight sets. Combined, only 1 of 9 matches this season went to 3 sets. Low hold rates (~67-73%) make tiebreaks less likely; breaks will decide sets.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 22% | 22% |
| 19-20 | 26% | 48% |
| 21-22 | 24% | 72% |
| 23-24 | 16% | 88% |
| 25+ | 12% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.5 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 28% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 72% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (67-73%), leading to multiple breaks per set. This creates 9-10 game sets (6-3, 6-4 type) rather than 12-13 game tiebreak sets.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With sub-75% hold rates, tiebreak probability is low (~15%). Each tiebreak adds 3+ games to total. Low TB expectation pushes total down.

- **Straight Sets Likelihood:** 62% chance of straight sets based on both players' dominance at Hobart. Ruzic leads H2H 2-0 on hard courts with scores of 6-3/6-1 (16 games) and 7-6/2-6/6-0 (25 games). If Ruzic dominates like Wuhan (16 games), total stays very low.

- **Tournament Form:** Ruzic averaging 19.7 games/match at Hobart; Cocciaretto averaging 21.0 (inflated by one 3-setter).

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 3 |
| Ruzic Leads | 2-1 (2-0 on hard) |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 19.7 |
| Avg Game Margin | 5.3 (Ruzic favored) |
| TBs in H2H | 1 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 33% (1/3) |

### H2H Match Details

| Date | Tournament | Surface | Winner | Score | Total Games |
|------|------------|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Oct 2025 | Wuhan Q1 | Hard | Ruzic | 6-3, 6-1 | 16 |
| Aug 2025 | Monterrey | Hard | Ruzic | 7-6(2), 2-6, 6-0 | 25 |
| Jul 2025 | Bastad | Clay | Cocciaretto | 6-3, 6-4 | 18 |

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 3 H2H matches, with high variance (16-25 game range). Hard court H2H strongly favors Ruzic and suggests lower totals.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 20.5 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| 1xBet | O/U 22.5 | ~38% | ~62% | ~4% | 4.3 pp Under |

**No-Vig Calculation:**
- Under 22.5 at 1.62 implies ~61.7% probability with ~4% vig
- Removing vig: ~59% market probability for Under
- Model: 72% Under → **4.3 pp edge**

### Game Spread

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.70 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.3 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have moderate hold rates (~67-73%) that lead to multiple breaks per set rather than tiebreaks. H2H on hard courts averaged only 20.5 games (16 and 25). With straight sets probability at 62% and low tiebreak expectation (~18%), the model projects 20.5 total games vs market line of 22.5. The 4.3 pp edge exceeds the 2.5% minimum threshold.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Pass |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Game spread market not available. Model projects Ruzic -2.5 game margin based on H2H dominance (2-0 on hard) and superior form, but without market pricing, no edge calculation possible. Pass on spread.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass if Under 22.5 moves beyond 1.50 (implied >67%)
- **Spread:** Already passing due to no market availability
- **Match Cancellation:** Monitor weather conditions

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Model assumes ~18% TB probability. If one player serves unusually well, TB could push total over.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Cocciaretto's hold data estimated from serve stats (not directly available). Actual hold could be higher.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Ruzic dominates like Wuhan (6-3, 6-1 = 16 games), Under hits easily. But Monterrey H2H went 25 games.

### Data Limitations

- Cocciaretto's specific hold/break percentages not found (estimated from serve/return stats)
- Tiebreak sample sizes moderate (51-85 career TBs)
- H2H sample very small (3 matches) with high variance

### Correlation Notes

- No other positions on this match
- Totals and spread would be correlated (lower total favors underdog cover)

### Workload Factor

- Cocciaretto has played 5 matches (11 sets) including qualifying vs Ruzic's 3 matches (6 sets)
- Higher fatigue could lead to either faster loss (lower total) or inconsistency (breaks both ways)
