## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 25 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 19.5 |
| **P(Over 19.5)** | 53.5% |
| **P(Under 19.5)** | 46.5% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Jovic's solid 69.9% hold rate suggests competitive service games, but Preston's estimated ~70% hold rate is uncertain. Both players hovering around 70% hold typically produces 9-10 games per set average.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** 25% P(at least 1 TB) adds variance. Jovic's poor 40% TB conversion means close sets may extend rather than end quickly in her favor.

- **Three-Set Probability:** 42% chance of three sets pushes the total significantly higher. If Preston competes (as she has all tournament), expect 25+ games.

- **Fatigue Factor:** Jovic played 2h54m in QF (30 games). If energy dips, Preston's steadier pace could force longer rallies and more service pressure.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 19.5 |
| **Target Price** | -115 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.9 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects 20.8 expected games, creating 2.9pp edge on Over 19.5. The 42% three-set probability is the key driver. Preston has been competitive all tournament (hasn't dropped a set), and Jovic's fatigue from a nearly 3-hour QF could reduce her dominance. Jovic's poor 40% tiebreak record means close sets are more likely to extend (7-5) than end in quick tiebreaks in her favor.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Preston +5.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects Jovic -4.2 game margin, giving Preston +5.5 a 53% cover probability (3.2pp edge). Preston's home crowd advantage, current form (career-best wins over Raducanu, Sramkova), and Jovic's potential fatigue all support the underdog covering. Even in a Jovic 2-0 win, 6-4, 6-3 (+5 margin) or tighter covers.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on totals if line moves to O/U 20.5 or higher
- Pass on spread if Preston line moves to +4.5 or shorter
- Pass if significant injury news emerges pre-match

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Jovic's 40% TB win rate (6-9 career) is below average. If sets go to TB, she may struggle, extending matches but adding variance.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Preston's hold % is estimated (~70-72%) from limited WTA data. True hold could be higher (reducing games) or lower (extending games).
- **Straight Sets Risk:** 58% P(straight sets) means the Under can hit with a 6-3, 6-2 type scoreline.

### Data Limitations

- Preston only has 12 WTA main-draw matches - small sample for hold/break
- No head-to-head history
- Preston's tiebreak sample is just 1 (won 7-6(4) vs Bouzas Maneiro)
- Limited historical data on Preston's serve efficiency vs WTA-level returns

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread positions are moderately correlated: if Preston competes well (covers +5.5), more likely to push Over
- No other open positions on this match
