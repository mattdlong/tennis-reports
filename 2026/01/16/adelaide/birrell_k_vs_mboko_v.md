## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Birrell wins) | P(Mboko wins) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 8% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 8% | 22% |
| 6-4 | 12% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 10% | 10% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 8% | 12% |

**Modeling Notes:**
- Mboko's higher break % (40% vs 36%) drives advantage in close games
- Birrell's lower hold % (64%) creates more break opportunities
- TB probability moderate (~20% per set) based on combined hold rates

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 35% (Mboko 30%, Birrell 5%) |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 65% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 35% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 10% |

**Key Observation:** Mboko's 100% 3-set rate in Adelaide (3/3 matches) and both players' moderate hold rates strongly suggest another extended match.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 12% | 12% |
| 21-22 | 18% | 30% |
| 23-24 | 22% | 52% |
| 25-26 | 20% | 72% |
| 27+ | 28% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 25.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 22 - 30 |
| **Fair Line** | 25.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 70% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 30% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (64-67%), creating frequent break opportunities. Neither is a serve-dominant player, leading to longer, more competitive games.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** ~35% chance of at least 1 TB. Mboko's 82% TB win rate and both players' willingness to compete deep in sets adds to total upside.

- **Three-Set Probability:** 65% probability of 3 sets based on:
  - Mboko 3/3 three-setters in Adelaide
  - Birrell's fighting spirit (comeback from 5-7 down in QF)
  - Moderate skill gap despite ranking differential

- **Fatigue Factor:** Mboko has played 7+ hours in 3 matches; Birrell played 3h 04m with cramps. Extended rallies may become scrappy, potentially adding games as both struggle to close out.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Mboko -3.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -7 |
| **Fair Spread** | Mboko -3.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Mboko Covers) | P(Birrell Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Mboko -2.5 | 62% | 38% | +2.0 pp (Mboko) |
| Mboko -3.5 | 54% | 46% | +0.5 pp (Mboko) |
| Mboko -4.5 | 46% | 54% | +3.2 pp (Birrell) |
| Mboko -5.5 | 38% | 62% | +5.8 pp (Birrell) |

**Key Insight:** Fair spread of -3.8 means Mboko -4.5 offers value on Birrell side. The three-set probability significantly impacts spread coverage - in 3-set scenarios, margins compress.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 21 |
| Avg Game Margin | 5 (Mboko favor) |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 0% |

**Previous Meeting:**
- July 2025, Canadian Open (Montreal), Hard
- Mboko won 7-5, 6-3 (21 total games)
- Mboko won 64% of second serve points
- Heavy groundstrokes troubled Birrell

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 1 H2H match - insufficient for strong conclusions. Current form and Adelaide-specific conditions more relevant.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have moderate hold rates (64-67%) creating frequent break opportunities. Mboko has gone to 3 sets in all 3 Adelaide matches, and Birrell showed fighting spirit in her 3h marathon QF. The 65% three-set probability drives expected total to 25.8 games, well above the estimated 22.5 line.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Birrell +4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Fair spread of Mboko -3.8 makes Birrell +4.5 attractive. In 3-set scenarios (65% likely), margins compress. Birrell's home crowd support, relative freshness (walkover R16), and Mboko's accumulated fatigue (7+ hours in 3 days) suggest the underdog can stay within 4 games.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on Over if line moves to 24.5+ (edge drops below 2.5%)
- Pass on Birrell +4.5 if line moves to +3.5 or shorter
- Pass entirely if Birrell shows significant movement limitations in warmup (cramping concern)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** 35% TB probability adds upside variance to totals. Mboko's 82% TB win rate could compress margins if match goes to TBs.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Tournament-specific stats used (limited sample). Season-long hold rates would provide better baseline.
- **Three-Set Dependency:** Both recommendations depend heavily on 3-set outcome. If Mboko dominates in straight sets (6-3, 6-2 type), both bets lose.

### Data Limitations

- Specific totals/spread betting lines not available (used estimates)
- Career average games per match not found
- Limited tiebreak data for Birrell
- Only tournament-specific hold/break stats available (not season-long)

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals and Spread Correlation:** Over bet and Birrell +4.5 are positively correlated (both benefit from 3-set outcome). Combined exposure: 2.0 units on same match. Consider reducing one position if risk management requires.
