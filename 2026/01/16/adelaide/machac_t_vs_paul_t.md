| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 58% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 35% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 12% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 24.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 21 - 29 |
| **Fair Line** | 24.5 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 (implied from H2H avg) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 66% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 34% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players hold at 81-84%, suggesting competitive service games with occasional breaks. Not serve-bot territory but solid enough to produce tiebreak potential (~35% for at least 1 TB).

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Medium-fast Greenset court in Adelaide is conducive to tiebreaks. With both players holding 81%+ of service games, expect 25-35% TB probability per set, adding ~0.5-1 games to total expectation.

- **H2H Pattern:** Critical factor - all 3 previous meetings went to 3 sets with average of 29 games. This is the strongest totals indicator, though sample size is limited.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** Both players dominating in Adelaide (0 sets dropped each) suggests potential for lopsided match. However, H2H suggests these players bring out competitive matches from each other.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 8.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.5 units |

**Rationale:** The H2H pattern is compelling - 100% of previous matches went 3 sets with an average of 29 games. Both players have hold rates of 81-84%, producing competitive service games rather than blowouts. The medium-fast Adelaide court adds tiebreak probability. While both players have dominated this week, their historical matchups suggest they elevate against each other.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Paul +2.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.75 units |

**Rationale:** Despite Machac's 2-0 hard court H2H lead, Paul's superior ranking and recent win % suggest this match should be closer to even. The wide confidence interval (-5 to +7) reflects genuine uncertainty. The expected margin of Paul -1.2 games makes the underdog spread attractive at standard lines.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Over** if line moves to 25.5+ (edge shrinks below threshold)
- **Pass on Spread** if Paul favored by more than -2.5 (value diminishes)
- Consider **passing** if injury news emerges affecting stamina (reduces game count)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Model assumes 35% TB probability. If no TBs occur, total drops 2-3 games; if 2+ TBs, total rises 3-4 games.
- **H2H Pattern Break:** The 100% 3-set H2H could break. If match goes in straight sets, total likely falls below 23.
- **Adelaide Form vs H2H:** Both players in dominant form (0 sets dropped each) conflicts with competitive H2H history.

### Data Limitations

- **Hold/break percentages:** Paul's hold % estimated at 83-85% (not exact figure found)
- **Tiebreak win rates:** Exact career TB win % not available for either player
- **Totals/spread odds:** No confirmed market lines at time of analysis - using implied lines
- **Sample size:** Only 3 H2H matches

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Paul +2.5 have mild positive correlation (3-set match helps both)
- Combined stake (1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25 units) within acceptable range for same-match exposure
