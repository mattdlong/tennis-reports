## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold/break modeling (Andreeva 72.8% hold, 27.2% break; Shnaider 69.3% hold, 35.4% break):

| Set Score | P(Andreeva wins) | P(Shnaider wins) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 12% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 35% | 12% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 10% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 6% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 6% | 5% |

**Key insight:** H2H history shows both prior matches were 6-2, 6-3 type scores. Andreeva's current form (dropping only 6 games in 2 Adelaide matches) supports dominant set scores.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 65% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 35% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 15% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 4% |

**Analysis:** Low tiebreak probability due to:
- Shnaider's lower hold rate (69.3%) makes breaks more likely
- H2H shows 0 tiebreaks in 2 prior meetings
- Both players have strong return games (48.6% and 51.8% BP conversion)

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 14-18 games | 35% | 35% |
| 19-20 games | 25% | 60% |
| 21-22 games | 20% | 80% |
| 23-24 games | 12% | 92% |
| 25+ games | 8% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 19.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 23 |
| **Fair Line** | 19.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 32% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 68% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Andreeva's 72.8% hold combined with Shnaider's 35.4% break rate suggests 2-3 breaks per set. Shnaider's 69.3% hold vs Andreeva's elite return (48.6% BP conversion) suggests additional breaks. This creates shorter sets (9-10 games) rather than extended hold-fests.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Very low (~15% for any TB). Neither player is a pure serve-bot, and H2H shows 0 tiebreaks. Low TB probability suppresses total.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 65% straight sets probability dramatically reduces totals. If Andreeva wins in straight sets like her last 2 Adelaide matches, expect 14-18 total games.

- **H2H Pattern:** Critical - prior meetings averaged only 16 total games (15 and 17). Both were one-sided straight sets.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Andreeva -5.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -9 |
| **Fair Spread** | Andreeva -5.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Andreeva Covers) | P(Shnaider Covers) | Edge vs -110 |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Andreeva -2.5 | 72% | 28% | 22.0 pp |
| Andreeva -3.5 | 65% | 35% | 15.0 pp |
| Andreeva -4.5 | 58% | 42% | 4.8 pp |
| Andreeva -5.5 | 48% | 52% | -2.0 pp |

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 2 |
| Andreeva Wins | 1 |
| Shnaider Wins | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 16.0 |
| Avg Game Margin | 8.0 games |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 0% |

### H2H Details

| Date | Tournament | Surface | Winner | Score | Total | Margin |
|------|------------|---------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Dec 2023 | Brisbane | Hard | Andreeva | 6-2, 6-3 | 17 | -7 |
| May 2024 | Paris 125 | Clay | Shnaider | 6-1, 6-2 | 15 | +9 |

**Critical Insight:** Both H2H matches were lopsided straight sets. On hard courts, Andreeva leads 1-0 with a 7-game margin. The pattern strongly favors low-game, one-sided matches.

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 2 H2H matches - use with caution but pattern is compelling.

**Note:** These two are doubles partners (won Brisbane and Miami 2025 together), so they know each other's games extremely well.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | -115 or better |
| **Edge** | 6.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** H2H history is the key driver - both prior meetings were blowouts averaging 16 total games. Andreeva's current Adelaide form (15 games/match average) and 65% straight sets probability strongly support the under. Both players' strong return games (48.6% and 51.8% BP conversion) create breaks and shorter sets rather than tiebreaks.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Andreeva -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Andreeva enters in peak form (dropped 6 games in 2 Adelaide matches) while Shnaider has had harder draws including a 3-set battle. H2H shows average margin of 8 games, and Andreeva won 7 games on hard court. Current form disparity and H2H hard court advantage support -4.5 coverage.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on totals** if line moves to 20.5 or lower
- **Pass on spread** if line moves to -5.5 or higher
- **Pass on both** if either player withdraws or shows injury in warm-up
- **Pass** if market lines differ significantly from estimates used

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If unexpected tiebreaks occur, totals could exceed model. However, H2H and current form suggest TBs unlikely.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Andreeva's hold (72.8%) below elite level means she faces break points - but she converts on return at 48.6%.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** If match extends to 3 sets, totals will likely go over. 35% three-set probability is the main under risk.

### Data Limitations

- **Market Lines Missing:** Using estimated lines (21.5 totals, -4.5 spread) - verify before betting
- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Andreeva's TB record unavailable; Shnaider's 12-8 has decent sample
- **H2H Sample:** Only 2 prior meetings - compelling pattern but small sample

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Under and Andreeva spread are positively correlated - if Andreeva dominates (covering -4.5), total likely stays under
- Consider reducing total stake if taking both positions (combined 1.5 units recommended vs 2.0 units)
