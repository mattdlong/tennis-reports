## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Davidovich Fokina wins) | P(Humbert wins) |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 3% | 8% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 12% | 22% |
| 6-4 | 15% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 10% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 12% | 14% |

**Modeling Notes:**
- Humbert's 87.3% hold vs ADF's 78% creates asymmetric set distribution
- Higher probability of Humbert winning sets with fewer games (6-2, 6-3)
- Both players capable of forcing tiebreaks when serving well

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 58% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 42% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 48% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 12% |

**Rationale:**
- Humbert's dominant Adelaide form (no sets dropped) suggests straight sets likely
- 9.3 pp hold differential (87.3% vs 78%) favors decisive sets
- Tiebreak probability elevated due to Humbert's serve dominance when holding

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 18% | 18% |
| 19-20 | 22% | 40% |
| 21-22 | 25% | 65% |
| 23-24 | 18% | 83% |
| 25-26 | 10% | 93% |
| 27+ | 7% | 100% |

**Key Insight:** 65% probability of 22 games or fewer supports Under 22.5

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 21.4 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 18 - 25 |
| **Fair Line** | 21.4 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 (expected) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 35% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 65% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Differential:** Humbert's 87.3% vs ADF's 78% creates asymmetric game distribution. When one player dominates service games while breaking the other, sets tend to finish quickly (6-3, 6-4 type scores) rather than going to tiebreaks.

- **Tiebreak Probability Impact:** While Humbert's elite hold rate could push sets to tiebreaks if ADF matches it, ADF's 78% hold is vulnerable. Humbert's break opportunities should yield shorter sets.

- **Straight Sets Likelihood:** 58% straight sets probability with Humbert dominating significantly reduces total. His Adelaide path (avg 18.0 games) and ADF's (avg 19.0 games) both trend low.

- **H2H Context:** Recent H2H meetings average 17-20 games in completed matches. The 6-3, 6-4 pattern in Humbert's wins suggests efficient victories.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Humbert -3.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -7 |
| **Fair Spread** | Humbert -3.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Humbert Covers) | P(ADF Covers) | Edge vs -3.5 |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Humbert -2.5 | 68% | 32% | N/A |
| Humbert -3.5 | 58% | 42% | +2.8 pp |
| Humbert -4.5 | 45% | 55% | -4.2 pp |
| Humbert -5.5 | 32% | 68% | N/A |

**Modeling Assumptions:**
- Expected margin derived from hold/break differential
- Humbert's straight sets victories in H2H (6-3, 6-4 and 6-1, 6-4) establish 4-5 game margin pattern
- ADF's ability to compete (3-3 H2H record) caps Humbert's margin upside
- -3.5 line offers value; -4.5 does not

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.91 (-110) or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Humbert's elite 87.3% hold rate combined with his ability to break Davidovich Fokina's vulnerable 78% hold creates a scenario favoring shorter sets. The H2H history (avg 18.6 games in completed matches) and both players' low game counts this tournament (Humbert 18.0 avg, ADF 19.0 avg) support under. The 9.3 pp hold differential is the primary driver.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Humbert -3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.91 (-110) or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects Humbert -3.8 fair line. His straight-sets H2H victories (6-3, 6-4 and 6-1, 6-4) established 4-5 game margins. With Humbert in peak form (32 winners, 7 UEs in QF) and ADF's serve vulnerable, -3.5 offers slight value. The outdoor hard court conditions favor Humbert's lefty serve and flat groundstrokes.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Over 22.5:** Model shows only 35% probability; no value
- **Pass on Humbert -4.5 or higher:** Model shows only 45% coverage; insufficient edge
- **Pass on ADF +2.5 or tighter:** Model projects Humbert advantage too large
- **Monitor line movement:** If Under moves to 21.5, re-evaluate edge

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** 48% chance of at least 1 TB. Each tiebreak adds 6+ games, shifting Over probability. Humbert's elite serve could force TBs if ADF matches intensity.

- **Davidovich Fokina Form:** ADF is competing as top seed for first time, has reached 12th career semifinal. Motivation could elevate hold rate beyond model expectation.

- **First Outdoor Hard H2H:** Previous H2H on indoor hard/clay. Outdoor conditions in Adelaide may produce different patterns.

### Data Limitations

- **Specific Odds Unavailable:** Using reference lines from earlier rounds; actual SF lines may differ
- **Tiebreak Sample:** H2H TB data (3 in 6 matches) is small sample
- **Surface Adjustment Uncertainty:** Indoor vs outdoor hard court stats not fully disaggregated

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Under and Humbert -3.5 are mildly correlated (both benefit from Humbert dominance). Consider combined exposure limit of 1.5 units if betting both.
- **No other open positions on these players assumed**
