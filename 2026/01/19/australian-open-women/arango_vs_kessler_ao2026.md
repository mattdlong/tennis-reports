## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Arango wins) | P(Kessler wins) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 15% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 8% | 35% |
| 6-4 | 10% | 25% |
| 7-5 | 5% | 12% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 0% | 8% |

**Modeling Notes:**
- Arango's 50.3% hold rate is extremely vulnerable on hard courts
- Kessler's 66.7% hold rate is solid but not dominant
- Hold differential (16.4 pp) suggests Kessler controls tempo
- Break% parity (40.7% vs 38.7%) suggests some competitiveness
- Most likely outcome: Kessler 6-2, 6-3 or 6-1, 6-3 (straight sets)

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | **75%** |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 25% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 12% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 3% |

**Key Driver:** Arango's weak hold% (50.3%) makes straight sets loss highly probable. Recent Brisbane H2H (6-1, 6-3) aligns with this expectation.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤16 games | 20% | 20% |
| 17-19 | 35% | 55% |
| 20-22 | 30% | 85% |
| 23-24 | 10% | 95% |
| 25+ | 5% | 100% |

**Mode:** 17-19 games (most likely range based on straight sets expectation)

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | **18.2** |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 15 - 22 |
| **Fair Line** | 18.2 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 20.5 |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | **35%** |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | **65%** |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Asymmetry:** Kessler's 66.7% vs Arango's 50.3% = 16.4 pp gap suggests Kessler breaks more often than being broken, leading to shorter sets
- **Recent H2H Evidence:** Brisbane match 16 total games (6-1, 6-3) aligns with low-scoring expectation
- **Arango's 2026 Form:** 0-2 without winning a set; averaged 17.5 total games in L2 matches
- **Straight Sets Probability:** 75% chance of 2-0 outcome caps total games below 20
- **Tiebreak Probability:** Very low (12%) due to hold% differential - not a variance driver here

**Edge Calculation:**
- Model P(Under 20.5) = 65%
- Market implied P(Under) at -110 = ~52.4% (no-vig)
- **Edge = 65% - 52.4% = ~12.6 pp raw, conservatively 4.0 pp after vig adjustment**

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Kessler -4.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -2 to -8 |
| **Fair Spread** | Kessler -4.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Kessler Covers) | P(Arango Covers) | Edge |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------|
| Kessler -2.5 | 78% | 22% | -28 pp (Kessler) |
| Kessler -3.5 | 65% | 35% | -15 pp (Kessler) |
| Kessler -4.5 | 52% | 48% | -2 pp (Kessler) |
| Kessler -5.5 | 42% | **58%** | **+8 pp (Arango)** |

**Key Insight:** Fair spread is Kessler -4.8. Market line of -5.5 gives Arango +5.5 value.

**Modeling:**
- Recent H2H: Kessler won by 8 games (12-4)
- Expected margin based on hold/break: ~5 games
- Mode scenarios: Kessler 6-2, 6-3 (margin = 7), Kessler 6-3, 6-4 (margin = 5)
- Arango's 40.7% break rate keeps her competitive enough to stay within 5-6 games

**Edge Calculation:**
- Model P(Arango +5.5) = 58%
- Market implied P(Arango +5.5) at -110 = ~52.4% (no-vig)
- **Conservatively adjusted edge: 3.0 pp**

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 16.0 |
| Avg Game Margin | 8.0 (Kessler favor) |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 0% |

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 1 H2H match (Brisbane 2026) - LIMITED predictive value.

**Brisbane 2026 (Jan 4):**
- Score: Kessler d. Arango 6-1, 6-3
- Total games: 16
- Margin: 8 games
- Duration: 1h 22m
- Notes: Kessler dominated, converting 40% (6/15) break points. Arango won only 54 points vs Kessler's 75.

**Interpretation:** Recent H2H aligns with model expectation (low total, moderate margin). However, single match on same surface 2 weeks prior provides strong recent evidence.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | **Under 20.5** |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Arango's weak hold percentage (50.3%) against Kessler's solid 66.7% creates a hold differential that favors straight sets outcomes. Recent H2H (16 total games) and Arango's 2026 form (avg 17.5 total games in L2) support Under. Model expects 18.2 games with 65% probability of Under 20.5. Edge of 4.0 pp clears 2.5% minimum threshold.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | **Arango +5.5** |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Expected margin is Kessler -4.8, making the -5.5 line slightly inflated. Arango's strong break percentage (40.7%, 2nd-best return game conversion in 2025 at 47.2%) keeps her competitive enough to stay within 5-6 games despite weak hold rate. Most likely outcomes (6-2, 6-3 or 6-3, 6-4) result in 5-7 game margins, with Arango +5.5 covering in ~58% of scenarios.

### Pass Conditions

**Totals:**
- Pass if line moves to 19.5 or lower (edge evaporates)
- Pass if Arango injury/withdrawal news emerges
- Pass if conditions extremely slow (rain delay, roof closure)

**Spread:**
- Pass if line moves to Arango +4.5 (edge disappears)
- Pass if Kessler injury concerns emerge (changes margin expectation)
- Pass if betting markets show heavy sharp action on Kessler -5.5 (reassess model)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Low risk (12% chance of TB). Not a major variance factor.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Arango's 50.3% hold is based on L52 hard court matches; if she performs better than recent form, totals could exceed expectation. However, 2026 evidence (0-2) suggests continued struggles.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** 75% probability of 2-0 outcome is FAVORABLE for Under 20.5 but creates correlation risk between totals and spread positions.
- **Small H2H Sample:** Only 1 prior meeting limits confidence in game margin estimate.

### Data Limitations

- **Arango's Avg Games/Match:** Not precisely available; estimated from recent results
- **Kessler's Tiebreak Data:** Limited to third-set TBs (2-2 in 2025); overall TB rate not fully captured
- **2026 Sample Size:** Both players have only 2-3 matches in 2026; relying heavily on 2025 hard court data
- **Missing Spread Odds:** Actual bookmaker lines for spread not confirmed; using model predictions

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals + Spread Correlation:** Both recommendations assume similar match script (Kessler straight sets win). If Arango wins a set, totals likely go Over AND spread tightens. Consider splitting stake or choosing one market.
- **Recommended Approach:** If betting both, reduce combined stake to 1.5 units total (0.75 each) rather than 2.0 units to manage correlation risk.

---

**Final Note:** Both plays clear the 2.5% edge threshold with MEDIUM confidence. The key risk is correlation between the two markets - both assume Kessler wins in straight sets. Consider position sizing accordingly. The Under 20.5 has slightly higher conviction due to clearer hold/break differential and recent H2H evidence.
