## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold rates (Linette 68%, Navarro 65.4%) - both in mid-60s range on hard courts:

| Set Score | P(Linette wins) | P(Navarro wins) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 3% | 5% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 12% | 18% |
| 6-4 | 15% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 18% | 20% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 11% | 10% |

**Analysis:** Both players have moderate hold rates (65-68%), creating competitive game dynamics. Neither player dominates on serve, leading to higher probability of extended sets (7-5, 7-6). Tiebreak probability elevated due to relatively even matchup.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 48% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 52% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 35% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 12% |

**Analysis:** Three-set probability elevated (52%) due to competitive hold/break rates and Linette's recent form (4 of 6 last matches went three sets). Navarro's 50% three-set record in 2025 (12-12) supports this assessment.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 28% | 28% |
| 21-22 | 24% | 52% |
| 23-24 | 26% | 78% |
| 25-26 | 14% | 92% |
| 27+ | 8% | 100% |

**Expected Total: 22.8 games (weighted average)**
**95% CI: 19-27 games** (reflecting high variance from potential three-setters and tiebreaks)

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 19 - 27 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.5 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 53.8% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 46.2% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players in mid-60s range (Linette 68%, Navarro 65.4%) creates competitive dynamics. Neither player has dominant serve, leading to more games per set. The narrow 2.6 pp gap suggests sets will be close rather than one-sided.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** 35% chance of at least one tiebreak based on competitive hold rates. Both players have shown tiebreak capability (Linette 55% career, Navarro 66.7% in small 2025 sample). Each tiebreak adds 1 game to the total, pushing toward higher outcomes.

- **Three-Set Risk:** 52% probability of three sets based on Linette's recent pattern (4 of 6 last matches) and Navarro's 50% three-set rate in 2025. A three-setter with competitive sets (6-4, 7-5 type) easily reaches 25+ games.

- **Recent Totals Context:** Linette's last 6 matches averaged 23.5 total games. Navarro's last 3 averaged only 17.7, but these were against lower opposition (Jones, Putintseva) before the Shnaider loss. The H2H in Toronto (18 games, 6-2 6-4) was on faster courts and may not reflect current conditions.

**Edge Calculation:**
```
Model P(Over 21.5) = 53.8%
No-vig market P(Over 21.5) ≈ 50.0% (assuming -110/-110 standard pricing)
Edge = 53.8% - 50.0% = 3.8 pp
```

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Navarro -3.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to 0 |
| **Fair Spread** | Navarro -3.0 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

Without market spread odds available, modeling theoretical lines:

| Line | P(Navarro Covers) | P(Linette Covers) | Edge |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| Navarro -2.5 | 54% | 46% | N/A |
| Navarro -3.5 | 47% | 53% | N/A |
| Navarro -4.5 | 38% | 62% | N/A |
| Navarro -5.5 | 28% | 72% | N/A |

**Analysis:** Expected margin of 3.2 games favoring Navarro, but wide confidence interval (±3 games) reflects high uncertainty. Navarro's superior break percentage (39.3% vs 31.5%) suggests she should win more games, but Linette's better recent form (4-2 vs 2-1) and higher hold rate (68% vs 65.4%) narrow the gap. The single H2H (6-game margin) is on faster surface and may not translate.

**Recommendation:** PASS on spread markets. Edge calculations impossible without market odds, and the wide confidence interval suggests high variance. Focus on totals market instead.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 18.0 |
| Avg Game Margin | 6.0 (Navarro) |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 0% |

**H2H Match Detail:**
- **Date:** August 8, 2024
- **Tournament:** National Bank Open (Toronto)
- **Surface:** Hard (outdoor)
- **Score:** Navarro won 6-2, 6-4 (18 games total)
- **Duration:** 1h 32m

**Sample Size Warning:** Only one previous meeting. Toronto courts play faster than Melbourne (GreenSet acrylic is slower/higher bouncing). The 18-game total from Toronto significantly below current model expectation (22.8) due to surface differences and Linette's improved recent form.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 (1.91) or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model expects 22.8 total games with strong support from competitive hold rates (both mid-60s), 52% three-set probability, and 35% tiebreak risk. Linette's recent pattern (23.5 avg last 6 matches, 4 three-setters) and Navarro's 50% three-set rate in 2025 align with over projection. The 18-game H2H total from Toronto is not representative due to faster surface. Medium confidence reflects data gaps (missing tiebreak frequencies, limited recent data for Navarro) and weather uncertainty (rain forecast could affect play).

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Pass |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No market spread odds available for comparison. Model suggests Navarro -3.0 fair value, but wide confidence interval (-6 to 0) indicates high uncertainty. Without market lines to compare against, edge calculation is impossible. Additionally, the conflicting signals (Navarro's better break %, but Linette's better recent form and hold rate) create ambiguity. PASS until spread markets become available and can be properly evaluated.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass if line moves to 22.5 or higher (eliminates edge). Pass if rain causes roof closure (changes playing conditions significantly).
- **Spread:** Pass indefinitely until market odds become available and edge can be properly calculated.
- **Both:** Pass if either player shows injury concerns during warm-up or if significant weather disruptions are confirmed.

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** 35% chance of at least one tiebreak, each adding 1 game. Linette has large tiebreak sample (179 career TBs, 55% win rate) but Navarro's 2025 sample is tiny (only 3 third-set TBs). Tiebreak outcomes highly random - could swing total by 1-2 games either direction.

- **Three-Set Uncertainty:** 52% model probability of three sets is highly sensitive to set 1 outcome. If Navarro dominates early (like Toronto 6-2 6-4), total crashes to 18-20 range. If Linette takes first set (possible given better hold rate), match likely extends.

- **Weather Impact:** 21.18mm rain forecast (wettest day of month) with 87% humidity. Potential for delays, roof closure (changing from outdoor to covered conditions), or damp court affecting ball bounce. Any interruption could disrupt rhythm and affect game flow.

- **Serve Volatility:** Both players have moderate double fault risk (Linette 0.23 DF/game, Navarro 3.36 DF ratio). Navarro had 5 DFs in Adelaide loss to Shnaider. Service struggles could lead to more breaks (higher total) or frustration-induced errors (lower total).

### Data Limitations

- **Missing Tiebreak Frequencies:** Neither player has surface-specific TB frequency data available. Model uses general hold rate assumptions (both 65-68% → ~20-25% TB rate per set) but actual rates could vary.

- **Navarro Recent Sample Small:** Only 3 matches in 2026, all in straight sets until Shnaider loss. Avg 17.7 total games is against weaker opponents (Jones, Putintseva). Unclear if this represents true current form or level-of-competition artifact.

- **Game Distribution Data Incomplete:** Neither player has detailed set score distribution percentages. Model relies on hold/break rates and general tennis probability distributions.

- **Odds Not Available:** Totals and spread betting odds not found in public sources. Edge calculation based on estimated standard pricing (-110/-110). Actual market may differ significantly.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Over 21.5 totals position has slight negative correlation with Navarro spread coverage. If match goes over (likely via three sets), it could indicate competitiveness favoring Linette, making Navarro less likely to cover large spreads. However, spread market not recommended anyway.

- **Weather Correlation:** Rain delay or roof closure affects both totals and any potential spread position. Covered conditions generally favor server slightly (less wind), which could help both players' hold rates and push total higher.
