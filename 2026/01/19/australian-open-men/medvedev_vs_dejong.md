## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

**Methodology Notes:**
Best of 5 format with large skill gap (Medvedev 84.3% hold vs De Jong 78-80% hold). Medvedev's elite return (28.1% RGW) vs De Jong's moderate hold rate suggests frequent break opportunities for Medvedev.

| Set Score | P(Medvedev wins) | P(De Jong wins) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 15% | 1% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 35% | 3% |
| 6-4 | 25% | 8% |
| 7-5 | 12% | 6% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 8% | 4% |

**Analysis:**
- Medvedev's dominance (50% probability of 6-0/6-1/6-2/6-3 wins) suggests quick sets
- De Jong most competitive at 6-4 and 7-5 (14% combined when he wins a set)
- Low tiebreak probability overall due to hold rate differential

### Match Structure (Best of 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Medvedev 3-0) | 68% |
| P(Medvedev 3-1) | 24% |
| P(Medvedev 3-2) | 6% |
| P(De Jong Wins) | 2% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 28% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 8% |

**Analysis:**
- 68% chance of 3-0 sweep aligns with Medvedev's 80% straight-sets rate in Brisbane
- De Jong has ~30% chance to steal a set (mostly competitive 6-4/7-5/7-6 scenarios)
- Low tiebreak probability due to Medvedev's elite return breaking De Jong's moderate hold rate

### Total Games Distribution (Best of 5)

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 18% | 18% |
| 21-24 | 32% | 50% |
| 25-28 | 28% | 78% |
| 29-32 | 16% | 94% |
| 33+ | 6% | 100% |

**Expected Total:** 25.8 games (95% CI: 21-31 games)

**Scenarios:**
- **3-0 Dominant (18%):** 18-21 games (e.g., 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 = 20 games)
- **3-0 Competitive (50%):** 22-27 games (e.g., 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 = 25 games)
- **3-1 with Competitive Sets (26%):** 28-33 games (e.g., 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 = 30 games)
- **Long Battle (6%):** 34+ games (3-2 or multiple TBs)

---

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 25.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 21 - 31 |
| **Fair Line** | 25.5 |
| **Market Line** | NOT AVAILABLE |
| **P(Over 24.5)** | 56% |
| **P(Under 24.5)** | 44% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Medvedev's 84.3% hold vs De Jong's 78-80% hold creates moderate gap. Not wide enough for blowout, not close enough for high-game marathon. Medvedev's elite 28.1% return games won suggests he'll break De Jong 3-4 times per set, keeping set scores in 6-2 to 6-4 range.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low TB probability (~28% for at least one) due to skill gap. When both players hold well (85%+ each), TBs are common. Here, Medvedev breaks often enough to avoid most TBs, reducing total games.

- **Best of 5 Format Variance:** First R1 match of 2026 for both. Medvedev's recent form (80% straight sets) suggests 3-0 sweep is most likely (68% probability), yielding 22-27 game range. If De Jong steals a set (32% chance), total pushes to 28-33 games.

- **Heat Impact:** 29°C forecast with possible spike to mid-30s. Heat could shorten points (more aces, fewer rallies) or create fatigue/cramping. Direction unclear - PASS factor.

### Market Comparison

**Issue:** No totals line available from bookmakers. Heavy mismatches (Medvedev -1587 ML) often lack totals markets in R1 of Grand Slams.

**Estimated Market Line:** If available, likely 24.5 or 25.5 games.

**Model vs Estimated Market:**
- Fair Line: 25.5
- Estimated Market: 25.5
- Edge: ~0 pp (no value either side)

**Recommendation:** PASS even if line appears. No edge detected, and wide confidence interval (±5 games) due to De Jong data limitations creates too much uncertainty for 2.5% minimum edge threshold.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Medvedev -9.3 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to -13 |
| **Fair Spread** | Medvedev -9.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

**Model Spreads (Estimated):**

| Line | P(Medvedev Covers) | P(De Jong Covers) | Edge vs Est. Market |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Med -6.5 | 72% | 28% | +2.1 pp (over-priced) |
| Med -7.5 | 64% | 36% | +1.8 pp |
| Med -8.5 | 58% | 42% | +1.2 pp |
| Med -9.5 | 52% | 48% | +3.2 pp (value at -110) |
| Med -10.5 | 46% | 54% | +2.1 pp (value on De Jong) |
| Med -11.5 | 38% | 62% | -1.2 pp |

**Analysis:**
- Fair spread around -9.5 games for Medvedev
- Model expects 3-0 wins with margins: 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 = -9 games; 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 = -11 games
- If De Jong steals a set (32% chance), margins compress: 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 = -7 games
- Highest edge likely at Medvedev -9.5 or De Jong +9.5 (both ~3% edge at standard pricing)

### Key Factors for Spread

1. **Hold/Break Differential:** Medvedev 84.3% hold + 28.1% RGW vs De Jong 79% hold + 33% RGW. Medvedev's advantage is significant but not crushing. Expect Medvedev to win ~60-65% of total games played.

2. **3-0 vs 3-1 Impact:** In 3-0 sweep (68% probability), margins typically -8 to -12 games. In 3-1 result (24%), margins compress to -5 to -9 games. This bimodal distribution creates value around -9.5 line.

3. **De Jong's Upset Potential:** Beat Davidovich Fokina and Griekspoor in 2025. If he plays his best (unlikely given 0-1 start and Adelaide loss), could push sets to 6-4/7-5 and keep margin under -7. Probability: ~15%.

4. **Heat & Best of 5:** Heat could favor younger De Jong (age 25 vs 30) in later sets IF match goes long. But Medvedev's fitness is excellent post-Brisbane, and 3-0 sweep avoids this scenario.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 25.5 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| **Market** | **NOT AVAILABLE** | - | - | - | - |
| Est. Market | O/U 24.5 | 46% | 54% | 4.5% | 0.0 pp |

**Note:** Estimated market line assumes typical 4.5% vig on totals. No actual market exists for this mismatch.

### Game Spread

| Source | Line | Medvedev | De Jong | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-----|------|
| Model | Med -9.5 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| **Market** | **NOT AVAILABLE** | - | - | - | - |
| Est. Market | Med -9.5 | 47% | 53% | 4.5% | +3.2 pp |

**Note:** If spread appears at -9.5 (-110 / -110 typical pricing), model gives 52% chance Medvedev covers vs 47% implied by market = 3.2 pp edge. Edge meets 2.5% minimum threshold but BARELY, and with LOW confidence due to data limitations.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | 0.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No totals market available, and even if it were, model shows no edge at likely 24.5 or 25.5 lines. Wide confidence interval (21-31 games, ±5 from mean) due to limited De Jong data and Best of 5 format variance creates too much uncertainty. Heat impact on match length is unclear (could shorten OR extend via cramping/fatigue). Medvedev's 68% chance of 3-0 sweep suggests 22-27 game range, but 32% chance De Jong steals a set pushes total to 28-33. Distribution too flat to provide edge. **PASS recommended.**

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Medvedev -9.5 (if available) |
| **Target Price** | -105 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model calculates fair spread at Medvedev -9.5 with 52% probability he covers. If market prices this at -110 (47% implied), edge is 3.2 pp, just above 2.5% minimum threshold. However, confidence is LOW due to:
1. No actual market available (heavy mismatch limits betting options)
2. Wide confidence interval on margin (-6 to -13 games)
3. Limited De Jong data at ATP level
4. Best of 5 format creates higher variance than Bo3

**IF market appears:** Small 0.5-unit stake justified at -105 or better on Medvedev -9.5. Medvedev's 84.3% hold + 28.1% RGW vs De Jong's 79% hold creates consistent break advantage, and 68% probability of 3-0 sweep suggests margins in -8 to -12 range. De Jong's 32% chance to steal a set (mostly via 7-5 or 7-6) compresses margin but usually keeps it above -7.

**Most likely outcome:** Medvedev 3-0 (6-3, 6-4, 6-3 = -10 game margin) or (6-4, 6-4, 6-2 = -10 margin). Covers -9.5 in most 3-0 scenarios.

### Pass Conditions

**Totals:**
- ALWAYS PASS (no market available)
- Even if line appears: PASS unless edge exceeds 4% to compensate for wide CI
- PASS if heat forecast changes significantly (above 35°C creates cramping risk)

**Game Spread:**
- PASS if no market available (current status)
- PASS if line moves beyond -10.5 (edge disappears)
- PASS if De Jong shows sharp practice form (unlikely but monitor)
- PASS if Medvedev injury/illness news emerges

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Best of 5 Format Variance:** Neither player has played Bo5 yet in 2026. Medvedev's Grand Slam experience is vast (3x AO finalist), but R1 jitters possible. De Jong's Bo5 experience at this level is minimal, creating wild uncertainty in stamina/mental factors.

- **Limited De Jong Data:** Only 1 match in 2026 (Adelaide qualifying loss). 2025 stats based on lower-tier competition. Hold % estimate (78-80%) has ±3% margin of error. If De Jong holds 75%, margin blows out to -12+. If he holds 82%, margin compresses to -6.

- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** De Jong's TB stats unknown (likely <10 career TBs at ATP level). If match features multiple TBs, outcomes are coin-flip variance that model cannot price accurately.

- **Heat Impact Unknown:** 29°C forecast manageable, but spike to mid-30s possible. Could shorten match (more aces, fewer rallies, quick sets) OR extend it (cramping, medical timeouts, slower pace). Direction unclear = variance without edge.

- **De Jong Upset History:** Beat Davidovich Fokina (then #44) and Griekspoor (then #27) in 2025. Shows he can elevate against better opponents. If he plays his career-best match, could win a set or two, compressing margin. Probability low (~15%) but non-zero.

### Data Limitations

- **No Totals/Spread Market Available:** All analysis is theoretical. Heavy mismatch (Medvedev -1587 ML) means books don't offer totals/spreads in most cases. Edges calculated vs "estimated" market lines.

- **De Jong Surface-Specific Stats Missing:** Limited ATP hard court matches against top-50 opponents. Hold % and break % based on 2025 overall stats, not surface/opponent-adjusted. Could be off by ±2-3 percentage points.

- **Best of 5 Adjustments Uncertain:** Medvedev's Brisbane stats (14.6 avg games per match) were Bo3. Scaling to Bo5 requires assumptions about 3-0 vs 3-1 vs 3-2 distribution. Model assumes 68% 3-0 rate based on Brisbane form, but first R1 match could differ.

- **Tiebreak Modeling Fragile:** Medvedev's recent TB performance (7-1 win in Brisbane final, but lost 2 of 3 TBs to Tien at AO 2025) shows high variance. De Jong's TB stats entirely unknown. Model uses 20% TB frequency but this could be 10-30% range.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** In mismatches, totals and spreads are negatively correlated. If Medvedev dominates (covers -9.5), match likely 3-0 = lower total (Under). If De Jong pushes (loses spread), match likely 3-1+ = higher total (Over). Avoid taking both sides.

- **Other Medvedev Positions:** If holding Medvedev futures (AO winner, etc.), this match is irrelevant (99%+ win probability). No correlation concern.

- **De Jong Futures:** If betting De Jong to upset, that contradicts spread/totals analysis. Avoid conflicting positions.

## Final Summary

**Totals:** PASS. No market available, and even if it were, model shows no edge. Wide confidence interval and heat uncertainty make this unplayable.

**Game Spread:** Medvedev -9.5 shows 3.2 pp edge IF market appears, but confidence is LOW due to no actual line, limited De Jong data, and Bo5 variance. Recommend 0.5-unit stake ONLY if line appears at -105 or better. Otherwise PASS.

**Most Likely Result:** Medvedev 3-0 (6-3, 6-4, 6-3 = 26 total games, -10 margin). Medvedev's elite return vs De Jong's moderate hold creates consistent break advantage, and recent Brisbane form (80% straight sets) supports sweep scenario.

**Key Insight:** Heavy mismatches like this rarely offer totals/spread markets. When they do, edges are thin because oddsmakers know sharp bettors will pounce on any mispricing. The 3.2 pp edge on Medvedev -9.5 is theoretical - in practice, if a line appears, it will likely be sharper than estimated. Monitor for market appearance, but expect PASS on both totals and spread.
