## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 35.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 31 - 40 |
| **Fair Line** | 35.2 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 38.5 |
| **P(Over 38.5)** | 30% |
| **P(Under 38.5)** | 70% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Asymmetry:** Ymer's estimated 82% hold vs Shevchenko's 73.8% hold creates a power imbalance favoring fewer games. When one player holds significantly better, sets tend to be decisive (6-4, 6-3 type) rather than extended.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With Ymer's strong hold rate and both players showing ~10-15% TB frequency, expected TB occurrence is below 40% for entire match (likely 1-2 TBs max). Lower TB rate = lower total games.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** Shevchenko's superior break % (23.7% vs 22%) and higher ranking suggests he could win decisively if Ymer's qualifier fatigue shows. Model assigns 25% probability to 3-0 outcome (typical range: 18-24 games).

- **Bo5 Format Adjustment:** Grand Slam format typically adds 8-12 games vs Bo3, but market line of 38.5 appears to overshoot this adjustment given the hold/break differential.

- **Fatigue Factor:** Shevchenko played 11 sets in 7 days (Adelaide), Ymer played 7 sets in 3 days (qualifying). Both carry workload, but extreme Melbourne heat could disproportionately affect the longer match, favoring shorter points and more service holds.

### Market Analysis

Market line of 38.5 implies expectation of competitive 4-5 set match with multiple tiebreaks. Model suggests this overestimates likely game count given:
- Shevchenko's clear quality edge (Rank #104 vs #175)
- Hold/break profiles favor decisive sets
- Recent form shows Ymer averaging 28.7 games (Bo3), which projects to ~34-36 in Bo5

**Edge calculation:**
- Model P(Under 38.5) = 70%
- Market no-vig P(Under 38.5) = 50% (balanced 1.85/1.85 odds)
- Edge = 70% - 50% = 20 pp raw
- Conservative adjustment for Bo5 variance: reduce to 3.8 pp actionable edge

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Shevchenko -3.1 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to +1 |
| **Fair Spread** | Shevchenko -3.1 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Shevchenko Covers) | P(Ymer Covers) | Edge |
|------|----------------------|----------------|------|
| Shevchenko -2.5 | 52% | 48% | N/A |
| Shevchenko -3.5 | 48% | 52% | N/A |
| Shevchenko -4.5 | 40% | 60% | N/A |
| Shevchenko -5.5 | 32% | 68% | N/A |

**Analysis:** Game handicap spread odds not available in market. Model suggests Shevchenko's superior ranking and slightly better break % translates to modest 3-game margin expectation, but with very wide confidence interval (-6 to +1). The matchup is closer than ranking gap suggests due to Ymer's strong qualifying run and Shevchenko's potential fatigue. Without market odds to compare, recommend PASS on all spreads.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Surface of H2H | Grass (Mallorca 2025) |
| H2H Result | Ymer won 6-4, 7-6(4) |
| Total Games in H2H | 22 |
| Game Margin | Ymer +4 |
| TBs in H2H | 1 |
| Match Format | Bo3 |

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 1 prior meeting on different surface (grass vs hard). H2H provides minimal predictive value for hard court matchup. Notably, that 22-game total was under typical Bo3 expectations, suggesting both players can play tight, efficient sets.

**Surface Adjustment:** Grass favors servers more than hard court, so Ymer's ability to take that match doesn't necessarily translate to hard court advantage where Shevchenko's return game (23.7% break rate) should be more effective.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 35.2 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Market (balanced) | O/U 38.5 | 46.2% | 53.8% | 7% | 3.8 pp Under |

**Market Interpretation:** Balanced 1.85/1.85 odds with ~7% total vig is standard. Market setting line at 38.5 suggests expectation of competitive 4-5 set battle. Model disagrees, favoring more decisive outcome with fewer games.

### Game Spread

| Source | Line | Fav | Dog | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Model | Shevchenko -3.1 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Market | Not available | - | - | - | - |

**Spread unavailable:** No game handicap market found for this first-round Grand Slam match. Common for lower-profile R128 matches.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 38.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.2 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects 35.2 total games with market set at 38.5, providing 3.3-game cushion. The hold/break differential (Ymer 82%/22% vs Shevchenko 73.8%/23.7%) suggests sets will be decisive rather than extended. Shevchenko's ranking advantage (#104 vs #175) supports potential for straight-sets or 4-set outcome. Both players' recent totals trend under (Ymer avg 28.7 in Bo3, Shevchenko skewed by short losses). Bo5 format adds variance but market appears to overcompensate. Key risk is extreme heat potentially leading to more service holds and tiebreaks, but fatigue from recent schedules cuts against marathon match.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Pass |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No game handicap spread available in market for this match. Additionally, model confidence interval is very wide (-6 to +1 games), reflecting high uncertainty in margin outcome. While Shevchenko projects as slight favorite for game margin (-3.1), the H2H shows Ymer won by +4 games previously, and the hold/break rates are relatively balanced. Without market odds and given high variance, pass is appropriate.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass if line moves to Under 37.5 or lower (edge eliminated). Pass if odds drop below 1.75 (insufficient value). Pass if extreme heat forecast upgraded (could boost hold rates unpredictably).

- **Spread:** Continue to pass unless market odds appear and offer edge ≥2.5% with model confidence improving.

- **Line Movement:** If Under 38.5 gets steamed and line moves to 37.5, reevaluate edge. If Over 38.5 attracts money and line moves to 39.5, edge increases to ~5 pp (consider adding).

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Bo5 Format Volatility:** Best of 5 format creates wider game distribution range (95% CI spans 31-40 games). A competitive 5-setter could push total to 42+ games, though model assigns this only 10% probability.

- **Tiebreak Uncertainty:** Both players have limited TB sample sizes (Ymer n=3, Shevchenko n=2). If actual TB frequency exceeds modeled 35%, total could rise by 3-5 games. However, Ymer's strong hold rate should limit TB occurrences.

- **Extreme Heat Impact:** Melbourne forecast shows potential 40°C+ temperatures. This could affect both players' stamina and hold rates unpredictably. Typically extreme heat favors servers (shorter points, fewer rallies) which would support Under, but if match extends to 4-5 hours, fatigue could lead to break clusters in later sets.

- **Shevchenko Fatigue:** Playing 11 sets in 7 days (Adelaide QF run) then traveling to Melbourne is significant workload. If fatigue manifests, his 73.8% hold rate could decline, leading to more breaks and potentially higher total. This is primary risk to Under thesis.

### Data Limitations

- **Hold % Estimate for Ymer:** 82% hold is derived from break point save % (53.76%) and recent performance, not direct service game statistics. Actual hold rate could range 78-86%.

- **Shevchenko Recent Totals Skew:** His last 5 match totals (11, 21, 27, 22, 7) include one 6-0 6-1 loss (7 games) that heavily skews average to 17.6. Removing outlier gives average of 22.75 for Bo3, which projects to ~34 for Bo5, supporting Under.

- **Limited Hard Court H2H:** Only 1 prior meeting on grass. Surface-specific matchup dynamics unknown.

- **No Point-Level Data:** Lack of first serve %, ace rate, and rally length statistics limits precision of hold/break modeling.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** If taking Under 38.5, spread bet on Shevchenko would be positively correlated (decisive Shevchenko win achieves both). However, no spread market available.

- **Match Winner Correlation:** Not analyzing moneyline per instructions, but Under 38.5 is correlated with Shevchenko winning (decisive outcomes = lower totals).

- **Portfolio Risk:** If holding other Under positions on early-round Grand Slam matches, consider concentration risk. First-round Bo5 matches tend to see more retirements and lopsided scores, which supports Under bias but creates correlation.
