## Mariano Navone - Hold/Break Profile

| Category | Stat | Value |
|----------|------|-------|

| **Hold %** | Service Games Held | **DATA NOT AVAILABLE** |
| | Note | Hong Kong match: 45.5% hold (5 of 11) - SINGLE MATCH ONLY |
| **Break %** | Return Games Won | **DATA NOT AVAILABLE** |

| **Tiebreak** | TB Frequency | **INSUFFICIENT DATA** |
| | TB Win Rate | 100% (n=1) - NOT RELIABLE |

| **Game Distribution** | Avg Total Games/Match | 24.5 (last 2 hard court matches) |
| | Avg Games Won | 10.5 |

| | Avg Games Lost | 14.0 |
| | Straight Sets Loss % | 100% (last 2 matches) |

| **Serve** | 1st In % | 65.0% |
| | 1st Pts Won % | 76.0% |

| | 2nd Pts Won % | 65.0% |
| | Aces/Match | 2.2 |

| **Return** | vs 1st % | 34.0% |
| | vs 2nd % | 51.0% |
| **Load** | Rest / Sets Last 7d | ~5 days / 3 sets (both losses) |

| **Surface Record** | Hard Court 2025-26 | 0-2 (2026), 5-12 (2025) |
| | Hard Court Career | 7-20 (25.9%) |
| | Clay Court Career | 55.3% |

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Navone's comprehensive hold/break statistics are missing. Only one documented service game hold rate (45.5% in Hong Kong) - far below tour average but from single match only. Cannot reliably model game distribution without this data.

## Game Distribution Analysis

### Modeling Limitations

**CRITICAL:** Cannot produce reliable set score probabilities without Navone's hold/break percentages. The following analysis uses:
- Medjedovic: 77.9% hold, 21.8% break (hard court data)
- Navone: **ESTIMATED 60-70% hold** (based on poor hard court results and single 45.5% match)
- Navone: **ESTIMATED 15-20% break** (inferred from poor return stats)

**WARNING:** These estimates have wide uncertainty bands. Model outputs should be treated as highly speculative.

### Set Score Probabilities (ESTIMATED)

| Set Score | P(Navone wins) | P(Medjedovic wins) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 18% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 8% | 28% |
| 6-4 | 12% | 22% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 12% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 10% |

**Assumptions:**
- Medjedovic's superior hold rate (77.9% vs estimated 65%) drives dominance in set scores
- Low tiebreak probability given hold rate differential
- Navone's poor hard court form suggests more lopsided sets

### Match Structure (ESTIMATED - Best of 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 3-0) | ~55% |
| P(Four Sets 3-1) | ~35% |
| P(Five Sets 3-2) | ~10% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 25-35% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 10-15% |

**Rationale:**
- Surface mismatch + form divergence → higher straight sets probability
- Best-of-5 format allows more variance than Bo3
- Medjedovic's TB win rate (71.4%) favors him in close sets

### Total Games Distribution (ESTIMATED)

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 12% | 12% |
| 21-24 | 28% | 40% |
| 25-28 | 35% | 75% |
| 29-32 | 18% | 93% |
| 33+ | 7% | 100% |

**Expected Total:** 26.5 games
**95% Confidence Interval:** 21-32 games (VERY WIDE due to data limitations)

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 26.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 21 - 32 |
| **Fair Line** | 26.5 |
| **Market Line** | **NO ODDS AVAILABLE** |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | ~75% (estimated) |
| **P(Over 24.5)** | ~60% (estimated) |
| **P(Over 26.5)** | ~50% (by definition) |
| **P(Over 28.5)** | ~30% (estimated) |

### Factors Driving Total

**Downward Pressure (Lower Total):**
- **Dominant favorite scenario:** Medjedovic's 77.9% hold vs Navone's estimated 65% hold creates hold rate gap of ~13pp
- **Form divergence:** Medjedovic 3-1 in 2026 on hard, Navone 0-2
- **Surface mismatch:** Navone's clay game doesn't translate to hard (25.9% career win rate)
- **Straight sets probability:** ~55% chance of 3-0 = 18-24 game range

**Upward Pressure (Higher Total):**
- **Best-of-5 format:** More sets = more games vs Best-of-3
- **Competitive sets possible:** If Navone's actual hold rate closer to 70%, sets could reach 6-4, 7-5
- **Tiebreak variance:** Any tiebreaks add 6+ games each
- **Medjedovic's recent avg:** 22.0 games/match (last 4) suggests competitive matches

**Estimated Fair Value:**
- **Central tendency:** 26.5 games (3-0: 22 games, 3-1: 28 games, 3-2: 35 games weighted)
- **Mode scenario:** 3-1 Medjedovic (28 games total)
- **Uncertainty:** ±5 games due to incomplete Navone data

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Cannot compare to market without odds. Cannot calculate edge. **MUST PASS.**

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Medjedovic -6.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -3 to -10 |
| **Fair Spread** | Medjedovic -6.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities (ESTIMATED)

| Line | P(Medjedovic Covers) | P(Navone Covers) | Edge |
|------|---------------------|------------------|------|
| Medjedovic -2.5 | 85% | 15% | Cannot calculate |
| Medjedovic -4.5 | 68% | 32% | Cannot calculate |
| Medjedovic -6.5 | 50% | 50% | Cannot calculate |
| Medjedovic -8.5 | 32% | 68% | Cannot calculate |

### Game Margin Scenarios

**3-0 Medjedovic (55% probability):**
- Blowout: 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 = 18-7 → **-11 game margin**
- Competitive: 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 = 19-13 → **-6 game margin**

**3-1 Medjedovic (35% probability):**
- Dominant: 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 = 20-13 → **-7 game margin**
- Tight: 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 = 23-19 → **-4 game margin**

**3-2 Medjedovic (10% probability):**
- Close: 6-4, 4-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 = 28-24 → **-4 game margin**

**Expected Margin Calculation:**
- (55% × -8.5) + (35% × -5.5) + (10% × -4.0) = -4.7 - 1.9 - 0.4 = **-7.0 games**

**Adjusted for uncertainty:** Fair spread = **Medjedovic -6.5 games**

**Recent Evidence:**
- Navone last 2 margins: -2 games (vs Michelsen), -5 games (vs Wong) → avg **-3.5**
- Medjedovic last 4 margins: +3, +7, +7, -5 → avg **+3.0** when winning

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** No market spread odds available. Cannot establish edge. **MUST PASS.**

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | **PASS** |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate |
| **Confidence** | **PASS** |
| **Stake** | **0.0 units** |

**Rationale:**

**PASS due to multiple critical issues:**

1. **Incomplete hold/break data:** Navone's service games held % and return games won % not available. Only one match sample (45.5% hold in Hong Kong) insufficient for modeling.

2. **No market odds:** Total games over/under line not available. Cannot compare model fair line to market, cannot calculate edge.

3. **Wide confidence intervals:** 95% CI spans 21-32 games (11 game range) due to data quality and Bo5 format variance.

4. **First H2H meeting:** No historical game distribution to validate model assumptions.

**Minimum requirements NOT met:**
- ✗ Complete hold/break data for both players
- ✗ Market totals odds available
- ✗ Edge ≥ 2.5% (cannot calculate)

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | **PASS** |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate |
| **Confidence** | **PASS** |
| **Stake** | **0.0 units** |

**Rationale:**

**PASS due to same critical issues:**

1. **Incomplete data:** Cannot reliably model game margin distribution without Navone's hold/break percentages.

2. **No market spread:** Game handicap line not available. Cannot establish edge.

3. **High variance:** Expected margin of -6.5 games has 95% CI of -3 to -10 (7 game range).

4. **Speculative estimates:** Model based on estimated 60-70% hold rate for Navone vs documented 77.9% for Medjedovic.

**Model estimate:** Medjedovic -6.5 games (but with low confidence)

**Minimum requirements NOT met:**
- ✗ Complete hold/break data
- ✗ Market spread odds available
- ✗ Edge ≥ 2.5% (cannot calculate)

### Pass Conditions

**For Totals:**
- ✓ Hold/break data incomplete (Navone missing critical stats)
- ✓ No market odds available
- ✓ First H2H meeting increases uncertainty
- ✓ Wide confidence intervals (±5 games)

**For Spread:**
- ✓ Hold/break data incomplete (Navone missing critical stats)
- ✓ No market spread odds available
- ✓ High margin variance in Bo5 format
- ✓ Limited recent form sample for Navone (0-2 in 2026)

**Market Line Movement Thresholds (if odds become available):**
- Would need totals line AND spread line to evaluate
- Would need complete Navone hold/break data to refine model
- Would require edge ≥ 2.5% after no-vig calculation
- Recommend revisiting if market posts totals/spread before match

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

1. **Navone Data Gap (CRITICAL):**
   - Missing comprehensive hold % and break % statistics
   - Only one match sample showing 45.5% hold rate (Hong Kong)
   - Model relies on estimates with ±5-10pp uncertainty

2. **Tiebreak Volatility:**
   - Medjedovic TB sample size small (n=7)
   - Each tiebreak adds 6+ games to total
   - P(at least 1 TB) = 25-35% adds significant variance
   - If Navone's actual hold rate higher than estimated, more TBs likely

3. **Best-of-5 Variance:**
   - Fifth set possibility increases game total range
   - Straight sets (3-0) = 18-24 games
   - Five sets (3-2) = 32-38 games
   - Wide outcome distribution vs Bo3 format

4. **Surface Mismatch Uncertainty:**
   - Navone's clay vs hard performance gap (55.3% vs 25.9%)
   - Unclear if recent struggles (0-2 in 2026) represent true level or variance
   - Adaptation to Australian Open conditions unknown

### Data Limitations

1. **Navone Hold/Break Missing:**
   - Cannot model set score probabilities reliably
   - Service games held % estimate: 60-70% (±10pp uncertainty)
   - Return games won % estimate: 15-20% (±5pp uncertainty)

2. **Tiebreak Statistics:**
   - Navone: Only 1 documented TB (won vs Rune 7-2)
   - Medjedovic: 7 TBs played (71.4% win rate) - small sample
   - TB frequency percentages not available for either player

3. **No Market Odds:**
   - Total games over/under not posted
   - Game handicap/spread not posted
   - Cannot perform edge calculation
   - Cannot identify value opportunities

4. **Limited Recent Hard Court Sample:**
   - Navone: Only 2 hard court matches in 2026 (both losses)
   - Recent avg total: 24.5 games (small sample)
   - Hold rate from single match (45.5%) may not be representative

5. **First H2H Meeting:**
   - No historical game distribution
   - No matchup-specific adjustments possible
   - Playing style compatibility unknown

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** If betting both markets, note positive correlation:
  - Higher totals = closer match = smaller margins
  - Blowouts = lower totals + larger margins
  - Recommend no more than 3.0 units combined exposure per match

- **Other Positions:** No information on other Australian Open positions
  - Consider overall Bo5 exposure if betting multiple R128 matches
  - Hard court specialists may have correlated performance
