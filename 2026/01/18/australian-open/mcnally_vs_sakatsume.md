## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(McNally wins) | P(Sakatsume wins) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 5% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 22% | 18% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 16% |
| 7-5 | 10% | 9% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 12% | 7% |

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 55% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 45% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 28% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 8% |

**Analysis:**
- Expert prediction of 3 sets aligns with match-up analysis
- McNally's inconsistency (won set 1, lost match vs Sierra) suggests volatility
- Sakatsume's poor tiebreak record (38%) means TBs less likely to occur at 6-6
- If TB occurs, McNally likely favored given Sakatsume's weakness

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 28% | 28% |
| 21-22 | 30% | 58% |
| 23-24 | 22% | 80% |
| 25-26 | 14% | 94% |
| 27+ | 6% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.4 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 19 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.4 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5* |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 58% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 42% |

*Estimated line - actual line not yet posted

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players estimated at 70-72% hold, suggesting moderate break frequency. Neither is a dominant server, so sets unlikely to be dominated by one player.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** ~28% chance of at least one TB. Sakatsume's 38% TB win rate is a variance driver - if set reaches 6-6, outcome unpredictable but leans McNally.

- **Three-Set Likelihood:** 45% probability of three sets. Expert prediction and McNally's recent inconsistency support this. Three sets pushes total to 24-28 range.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 55% probability. If McNally dominates (55% overall win probability), could see 6-2, 6-3 type scores (18-20 games).

**Net Assessment:** Market line of 21.5 appears slightly low given:
1. High three-set probability (45%)
2. Competitive match-up despite ranking gap
3. Both players' recent match totals averaging 20-22 games

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players show moderate hold rates (70-72% estimated) with competitive break patterns. High three-set probability (45%) driven by McNally's inconsistency and Sakatsume's strong 2026 form. Expert consensus on 3 sets, recent match totals averaging 20-22 games, and competitive match-up all support over. Market line of 21.5 undervalues three-set scenarios.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Sakatsume +3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Sakatsume has covered -2.5 games in 10 of 11 recent matches, demonstrating ability to keep matches competitive. McNally's inconsistency (recently lost after winning first set) and return from injury suggests vulnerable to tight matches. If three sets occur (45%), margin typically stays within 4 games. Model fair line of McNally -2.8 suggests +3.5 offers value.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on totals if line moves to 22.5 or higher
- Pass on spread if Sakatsume line moves to +4.5 or larger
- Pass if injury news emerges for either player pre-match
- Pass if actual market lines differ significantly from estimates

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Sakatsume's 38% TB win rate is major variance driver. If sets reach 6-6, outcomes unpredictable. Could push totals higher (13 games per TB set) or create blowout if she loses confidence.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Exact hold/break percentages not available - estimates based on first serve and break point conversion stats. Actual hold rates could vary ±5%.

- **Three-Set Dependency:** Totals recommendation heavily dependent on 45% three-set probability. If McNally dominates (straight sets), over likely misses.

### Data Limitations

- **Missing hold/break %:** Exact service games held percentage not found for either player - derived from serve point stats
- **McNally sample size:** Only 14 matches in 2025, limited recent data post-surgery
- **Tiebreak sample:** McNally's tiebreak stats unknown - using general estimates
- **No H2H data:** First meeting means no head-to-head game distribution data

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Sakatsume +3.5 are positively correlated (both benefit from three sets)
- Consider reducing stake if playing both markets on same match
- Combined exposure should not exceed 1.5 units
