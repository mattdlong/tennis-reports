## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Jacquemot wins) | P(Kostyuk wins) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 1% | 25% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 3% | 45% |
| 6-4 | 4% | 15% |
| 7-5 | 2% | 5% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 2% | 5% |

**Dominant Scenario:** Kostyuk 70% to win sets at 6-3 or better.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 85% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 15% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 12% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 3% |

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 35% | 35% |
| 19-20 | 30% | 65% |
| 21-22 | 20% | 85% |
| 23-24 | 10% | 95% |
| 25+ | 5% | 100% |

**Mode:** 18-20 games (typical dominant 2-0: 6-3, 6-3 = 18 games or 6-2, 6-4 = 18 games)

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 19.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 16 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 19.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 20.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | 38% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | 62% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Kostyuk (~75%) vs Jacquemot (~60%) creates asymmetric scenario. Jacquemot struggles to hold, while Kostyuk breaks frequently. This leads to shorter games, not extended rallies to TB.
- **Tiebreak Probability:** LOW (~12%). The hold/break differential suggests Kostyuk will break early and avoid tiebreaks. Jacquemot's 0/3 BP conversion vs Frech and being broken 5x vs Tomljanovic indicates she won't pressure Kostyuk's serve.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** HIGH (85%). Expert consensus unanimous on Kostyuk 2-0. Jacquemot's recent matches averaged just 10 total games.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Kostyuk -5.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -2 to -10 |
| **Fair Spread** | Kostyuk -5.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Kostyuk Covers) | P(Jacquemot Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Kostyuk -2.5 | 82% | 18% | N/A |
| Kostyuk -3.5 | 75% | 25% | N/A |
| Kostyuk -4.5 | 68% | 32% | 3.8 pp |
| Kostyuk -5.5 | 58% | 42% | N/A |
| Kostyuk -6.5 | 45% | 55% | N/A |

**Key Insight:** Jacquemot won just 4 games in each of her last two matches. If that trend continues, Kostyuk covers any reasonable spread.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 20.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Kostyuk's dominant serve (75% hold) combined with Jacquemot's poor hold rate (~60%) and terrible 2026 form (averaging 4 games won) points to a blowout. The 85% straight sets probability and low tiebreak likelihood (12%) suggest a 6-3, 6-3 or 6-2, 6-4 scoreline (18 games). Under 20.5 has clear value.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Kostyuk -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Expected margin of -5.8 games gives comfortable cushion above -4.5 line. Jacquemot's 4-game average in 2026 losses and Kostyuk's form (12.4 games won avg at Brisbane) support a 5-6 game margin. If Kostyuk wins 6-2, 6-3 (typical dominant 2-0), margin is -7 games.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on totals if line moves to Under 18.5 or lower
- Pass on spread if line moves to Kostyuk -6.5 or higher
- Pass if significant injury news emerges for either player

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Grand Slam Stage Nerves:** Jacquemot may compete better on big stage than warmup events
- **Kostyuk Comedown:** After Brisbane final loss, motivation/energy questions (mitigated by 6 days rest)
- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If match goes tighter than expected, even one TB adds 13 games to a set

### Data Limitations

- Jacquemot exact hold % not available; estimated from poor recent form
- No H2H data for validation
- Market totals/spread lines estimated (not confirmed from bookmakers)
- Tiebreak sample for Jacquemot insufficient

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Under and Kostyuk spread correlated (both benefit from dominant performance)
- Consider reducing combined exposure if betting both: max 1.5 units total
