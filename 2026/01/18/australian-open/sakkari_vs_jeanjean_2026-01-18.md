## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold/break differential (Sakkari 66.2% hold vs Jeanjean ~62% hold; Sakkari 31.6% break vs Jeanjean ~30% break estimated):

| Set Score | P(Sakkari wins) | P(Jeanjean wins) |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 1% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 35% | 5% |
| 6-4 | 22% | 8% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 4% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 3% |

**Rationale:**
- Sakkari's superior break point conversion (43.9% vs 39.8%) drives dominance in decisive moments
- Jeanjean's low BP saved rate (41.9%) makes her vulnerable to multiple breaks per set
- Low tiebreak probability due to expected breaks on both sides

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 72% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 28% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 15% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 3% |

**Key Insight:** Both players have moderate hold rates (66% and ~62%), which creates break opportunities and reduces tiebreak likelihood. Combined with Sakkari's clear break advantage, straight sets are heavily favored.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤17 games | 25% | 25% |
| 18-19 | 30% | 55% |
| 20-21 | 20% | 75% |
| 22-23 | 12% | 87% |
| 24-26 | 8% | 95% |
| 27+ | 5% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 18.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 16 - 22 |
| **Fair Line** | 18.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 19.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 19.5)** | 45% |
| **P(Under 19.5)** | 55% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (66% and ~62%), suggesting 2-3 breaks per set are likely. This typically produces 9-10 games per set rather than 11-13 (TB scenarios). With 72% straight sets probability, expected total is 18-19 games.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Only ~15% chance of any tiebreak given break-heavy matchup. This caps upside for totals. Each TB adds 3 games vs a 6-4 set, but low probability means minimal impact on expected value.

- **Straight Sets Likelihood:** 72% P(2-0) heavily weights distribution toward 17-20 games. Jeanjean's 0-3 AO first round record and poor 2026 start (0-2) suggest vulnerability to quick exits.

- **H2H Precedent:** Previous Sakkari win was 6-3, 6-2 (17 games) on grass. Different surface but demonstrates dominance pattern.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Sakkari -5.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | Sakkari -9 to Sakkari -2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Sakkari -5.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Sakkari Covers) | P(Jeanjean Covers) | Edge vs Even |
|------|-------------------|--------------------| -----------|
| Sakkari -2.5 | 75% | 25% | +25 pp |
| Sakkari -3.5 | 68% | 32% | +18 pp |
| Sakkari -4.5 | 58% | 42% | +8 pp |
| Sakkari -5.5 | 45% | 55% | -5 pp |
| Sakkari -6.5 | 35% | 65% | -15 pp |

**Key Finding:** Fair spread sits between -4.5 and -5.5. Market estimate of -4.5 to -5.5 aligns with model. At -4.5, Sakkari has 58% coverage probability, offering approximately 8 pp edge vs 50% implied. After accounting for typical -110 juice, edge is approximately 2.8 pp.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 2 |
| Sakkari Wins | 1 |
| Jeanjean Wins | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 17 (1 match w/ full data) |
| Avg Game Margin | 7.0 (Sakkari +7 in 2022) |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 0% (of 1 recorded) |

**Recent H2H:**
- 2022 Berlin (Grass): Sakkari def. Jeanjean 6-3, 6-2 (17 games, margin +7)

**Surface Warning:** No hard court H2H meetings. Both previous matches were on grass (Sakkari won) and clay (Jeanjean won). Hard court neutral territory, but Sakkari's overall hard court experience (289 matches) vastly exceeds Jeanjean's.

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 2 H2H matches with limited data. Do not over-weight this factor.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 19.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.91 (-110) or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Moderate hold rates from both players (66% Sakkari, ~62% Jeanjean estimated) create a break-heavy matchup with low tiebreak probability (~15%). Combined with 72% straight sets probability, expected total of 18.8 games falls below the estimated 19.5 market line. Jeanjean's weak BP saved rate (41.9%) and poor recent form (0-2 in 2026, both straight set losses) support a dominant Sakkari performance with limited games.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Sakkari -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.91 (-110) or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects 5.2-game margin for Sakkari, making -4.5 the playable line. Sakkari's superior break point conversion (43.9% vs 39.8%) and Jeanjean's serve vulnerability (only 41.9% BP saved) drive the margin. Previous H2H produced 7-game margin (6-3, 6-2). However, edge is marginal and confidence is LOW due to incomplete data on Jeanjean's hold percentage.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Market line moves to 18.5 or below (edge evaporates)
- **Pass on Spread if:** Market line moves to -5.5 or higher (model shows Jeanjean +5.5 as slight favorite at 55%)
- **General Pass:** If Sakkari shows any pre-match fitness concerns (would affect stamina and game count)

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Low expected TB rate (15%), but if both players hold well early, TBs would add 3-6 games to total. Each unexpected TB significantly impacts Under bet.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Jeanjean's hold % is estimated, not directly measured. If she holds better than expected (~70%+), game count could rise and margin could shrink.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 72% P(2-0) is favorable for Under, but a third set would add 8-13 games, pushing total to 25+.

### Data Limitations

- **Jeanjean Hold %:** Not available in data. Estimated from break frequency (56% over 3.5 breaks suggests ~35% break rate against, implying ~65% hold). Lower confidence in this estimate.

- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** No TB statistics available for either player in collected data. TB modeling based on hold rate formulas rather than historical TB performance.

- **Hard Court H2H:** Zero hard court meetings. Both previous H2H matches on different surfaces provide limited predictive value.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Under and Sakkari -4.5 are moderately correlated. Both benefit from Sakkari dominance. If taking both positions, consider combined exposure of 1.5 units rather than 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.5 (no adjustment needed as positions are not contradictory).

- **Set Betting Correlation:** Sakkari 2-0 @ 1.66 (mentioned in data) aligns with both recommendations. Not a direct hedge but validates thesis.
