## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 19 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 58% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 42% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate-to-weak hold rates (68.65% and 61%), suggesting 3-4 breaks per set. This creates volatility but leans toward longer sets when service breaks trade back and forth.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** 28% chance of at least one tiebreak. Yastremska's excellent TB record (81%) means TBs she reaches likely add games. P(7-6 set) ≈ 15% combined.

- **Three-Set Probability:** 55% chance of three sets based on H2H (67% went 3 sets) and competitive hold/break matchup. Third set adds 8-12 games to total.

- **H2H Context:** Historical average of 22.3 games in their 3 meetings, all competitive despite Ruse winning.

| Yastremska -5.5 | 28% | 72% | +4.2 pp (Ruse) |

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have moderate hold rates (68.65% and 61%) that suggest multiple breaks per set, creating back-and-forth games. The H2H averages 22.3 games with 67% three-setters. With 55% P(3 sets) and 28% P(TB), the expected total of 22.8 exceeds the estimated 21.5 line.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Ruse +3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Ruse leads the H2H 3-0 with an average margin of only 2.7 games in Yastremska's losses. The model expects Yastremska to win by only 2.4 games. If Ruse can replicate past competitiveness, +3.5 has value. However, Yastremska has improved since their last meeting.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Line opens at 23.0 or higher (edge disappears)
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line opens at Yastremska -2.5 or shorter (no value on Ruse)
- **Reconsider if:** Either player shows injury concerns in warm-up

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Yastremska's 81% TB win rate vs unknown Ruse TB rate creates uncertainty. If no TBs occur, total likely lower.
- **Form Question Marks:** Both players lost badly in their last matches (Yastremska 1-6 0-6, Ruse 0-6 3-6). Form is unstable.
- **Three-Set Dependency:** The Over 21.5 recommendation relies on 55% P(3 sets). If Yastremska dominates 6-2 6-3, total is only 17.

### Data Limitations

- **Totals/Spread Lines Missing:** Market lines estimated based on ML odds. Wait for actual lines before betting.
- **Ruse Hard Court Data Limited:** Hold % of 61% is estimated from limited hard court sample.
- **Ruse Tiebreak Stats Unknown:** Cannot model TB outcomes for Ruse with confidence.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** If backing Ruse +3.5, avoid also backing Over heavily. A competitive Ruse performance means three sets (helping Over), but a Ruse upset means shorter margin (helping spread). Moderate positive correlation.
