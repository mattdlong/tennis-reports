## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 38.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 34 - 43 |
| **Fair Line** | 38.5 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 37.5 |
| **P(Over 37.5)** | 58% |
| **P(Under 37.5)** | 42% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Korda's strong hold (79%) vs Zheng's estimated lower hold (72%) creates moderate break opportunities. Both players have break potential, suggesting extended games per set.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Elevated TB expectation (~55% for at least 1 TB) adds variance and total games. Korda had TBs in 3 of last 4 matches; Zheng had TBs in 2 of 3 qualifiers.

- **Three-Setter Tendency:** Korda admits "battling three sets every match" - historically does not dominate early rounds at AO. Bo5 format allows this to extend to 4-5 sets.

- **First Meeting Factor:** No tactical familiarity may lead to more competitive early sets as players adjust.

| **Expected Game Margin** | Korda -4.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -8 |
| **Fair Spread** | Korda -4.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Korda Covers) | P(Zheng Covers) | Edge |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| Korda -2.5 | 68% | 32% | - |
| Korda -3.5 | 60% | 40% | - |

| **Korda -5.5** | **44%** | **56%** | **5.2 pp** |
| Korda -6.5 | 38% | 62% | - |

### Critical Historical Pattern

**Korda has FAILED to cover -5.5 games in each of his last 3 Australian Open first round wins:**
- This is a strong situational angle supporting Zheng +5.5
- Korda advances but doesn't dominate

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 37.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Korda's three-set tendencies, elevated tiebreak probability (~55% for at least one TB), and his weak tiebreak conversion rate (49.1%) suggest extended matches. The Bo5 format amplifies this - Korda rarely dominates R1 at AO. The 37.5 line underestimates the 4-set match likelihood.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Zheng +5.5 |
| **Target Price** | 2.00 or better |
| **Edge** | 5.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.5 units |

**Rationale:** Korda has failed to cover -5.5 in his last 3 AO R1 wins - a compelling situational pattern. Zheng's resilience (saved match point in qualifying) and Korda's inconsistent closing ability support the underdog spread. Model fair line of Korda -4.2 offers value on Zheng +5.5.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on totals if line moves to 38.5 (no edge)
- Pass on spread if line moves to Korda -4.5 or lower (reduced edge)
- Reduce stakes if Zheng shows fatigue signs in pre-match warmup

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If TB rate is lower than expected, totals could come under. Korda's weak TB record (49.1%) is double-edged - he may lose TBs to Zheng, affecting margin.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Zheng's hold rate is estimated from qualifying data against lower-level opponents. Against Korda's return game, his hold % may drop significantly.

- **Best of 5 Format:** More sets = more variance. A 5-set thriller (45+ games) or a dominant 3-0 (30 games) are both possible.

### Data Limitations

- **Zheng Hold/Break Data:** Limited ATP-level statistics. Qualifying data is best available but may not translate to main draw.

- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Zheng has only 2 TBs in recent data - insufficient for reliable TB win rate estimates.

- **Korda Form:** 2-2 in 2026 with recent losses to Michelsen and Kokkinakis - form questions persist.

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Zheng +5.5 are **positively correlated** - more games generally means closer margin
- If taking both, cap combined exposure at 2.0 units
- A Korda 3-0 blowout (under 32 games, margin 8+) would lose both bets
