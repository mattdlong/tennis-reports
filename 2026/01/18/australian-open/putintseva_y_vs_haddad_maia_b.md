## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Putintseva wins) | P(Haddad Maia wins) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 3% | 5% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 10% | 15% |
| 6-4 | 15% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 10% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 6% | 10% |

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 35% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 65% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 25-30% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 8-10% |

**Rationale:** 100% of H2H matches went 3 sets. Expert consensus predicts 3 sets. Haddad Maia's 80% 3-set rate strongly supports this expectation.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 15% | 15% |
| 21-22 | 18% | 33% |
| 23-24 | 22% | 55% |
| 25-26 | 20% | 75% |
| 27+ | 25% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 24.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 21 - 28 |
| **Fair Line** | 24.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 67% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 33% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have sub-elite hold rates. Putintseva's serve is a known vulnerability (~65-70% hold). Haddad Maia slightly better (~72-75%) due to height. Combined weak hold rates suggest multiple break opportunities per set, but also more games needed to close sets.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With moderate hold rates, TB probability per set is ~15-20%. However, Abu Dhabi H2H had 2 TBs (32 games). If match goes tight, tiebreaks could push total significantly higher.

- **Three-Set Likelihood:** This is the primary driver. With 100% H2H three-set rate and 80% three-set rate for Haddad Maia recently, we strongly expect 2-1 result. Even a low-scoring 3-setter (6-3, 4-6, 6-4) yields 23 games.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Haddad Maia -2.3 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to +2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Haddad Maia -2.3 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Haddad Maia Covers) | P(Putintseva Covers) | Edge |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|------|
| Haddad Maia -2.5 | 47% | 53% | -3% (pass) |
| Haddad Maia -3.5 | 42% | 58% | +3.2 pp |
| Haddad Maia -4.5 | 35% | 65% | +8 pp (estimated) |
| Haddad Maia -5.5 | 28% | 72% | +12 pp (estimated) |

**Analysis:** H2H average margin is only 2 games (19: margin 3, 32: margin 1). Despite 2-0 H2H for Haddad Maia, margins have been tight. The -3.5 line is too wide given competitive nature of matchup.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Strong three-set expectation (100% H2H, 80% for Haddad Maia recently) drives higher total. Both players have breakable serves but are capable of extending sets. H2H average of 25.5 games supports Over. The Abu Dhabi match (32 games with 2 TBs) shows upside potential.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Putintseva +3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** H2H margins are tight (avg 2 games) despite Haddad Maia winning both. Putintseva is the superior returner (48.8% BP conversion vs 39.9%) and can steal games consistently. Even in losses, she stays competitive - Wimbledon was 3-game margin, Abu Dhabi was 1-game margin. The -3.5 line overestimates Haddad Maia's dominance.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on totals if line moves to O/U 24.5 or higher
- Pass on spread if line moves to Haddad Maia -2.5 or tighter
- Pass if either player withdraws or shows injury in warm-up

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** TB rates could swing total ±3 games. Haddad Maia's 54% TB win rate vs Putintseva's 47% creates asymmetric TB outcome probability.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Exact hold percentages not available. Estimates based on serving profiles and expert descriptions. If Putintseva holds better than expected, total drops.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Haddad Maia dominates (unlikely given H2H), straight sets 6-3, 6-2 would yield only 17 games, well under.

### Data Limitations

- **Missing Hold/Break Data:** Exact surface-adjusted hold % not found for either player. Analysis relies on qualitative profiles and derived estimates.
- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Putintseva 162 TBs, Haddad Maia 149 TBs - adequate samples.
- **Limited 2026 Data for Haddad Maia:** Only 1 match in 2026 (loss to Mboko). Form uncertain.

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Putintseva +3.5 are **positively correlated**: three-setters increase both total games and underdog's chances to stay within margin.
- Combined exposure: 2.0 units on same match. If capping at 2.0 units total, split 1.0/1.0 is appropriate.
