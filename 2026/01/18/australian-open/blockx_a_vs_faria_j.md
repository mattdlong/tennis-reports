| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 22% | 12% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 14% |
| 7-5 | 10% | 8% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 15% | 12% |

**Note:** Probabilities estimated from hold/break rates. Limited precision due to data gaps.

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 37.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 32 - 43 |
| **Fair Line** | 37.5 |
| **Market Line** | Not available |
| **P(Over 36.5)** | ~55% |
| **P(Under 36.5)** | ~45% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players showing strong hold rates (Faria 89-93%, Blockx estimated ~77%). Higher hold rates favor more games per set and tiebreak potential.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Moderate tiebreak risk (~45% for at least 1 TB). Both players have shown tiebreak capability in recent matches. Each TB adds 13 games to set total vs typical 10.

- **Match Length Risk:** Bo5 format at Grand Slam significantly increases variance. Blockx has gone 3 sets in 4 of 7 recent matches while Faria won all qualifying in straight sets - suggests competitive match likely.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Blockx dominates (32% 3-0 probability), total could be as low as 26-30 games. This is the main downside risk to overs.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Market lines for total games not available. Model suggests fair line around 37.5 games but without actual market pricing, cannot calculate edge. Additionally, hold/break data for Blockx is estimated rather than confirmed, and his retirement in qualifying raises fitness concerns that could impact match length. Pass until market lines are available and can confirm >2.5% edge.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Market lines for game handicap not available. Model suggests fair spread around Blockx -4.5 but without market pricing cannot calculate edge. Blockx is favored on form (Canberra title, ranking 95 vs 151) but Faria's dominant qualifying run and higher hold rates suggest competitive match. Pass until spread lines available.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass on any line where edge <2.5% OR if tiebreak probabilities change significantly
- **Spread:** Pass on Blockx -5.5 or larger due to reduced coverage probability
- **Market Movement:** Re-evaluate if lines move >1.5 games from expected fair values

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** ~45% chance of at least 1 TB. Each tiebreak adds 3+ games to the set total. With limited TB sample for both players (n=2 each), actual TB rates could differ significantly.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Blockx hold % is estimated (~77%) from break points saved rather than direct measurement. If his actual hold is higher (80%+), expect more tiebreaks and higher totals.

- **Bo5 Format:** Grand Slam format significantly increases variance. A 5-set match could push totals to 45+ while a dominant 3-0 could be under 30 games.

### Data Limitations

- **Missing:** Exact hold % for Blockx (estimated from break points saved)
- **Missing:** Exact break % for both players
- **Missing:** Career tiebreak records (only 2 recent TBs each)
- **Missing:** Total games betting lines and odds
- **Missing:** Game handicap spread betting lines
- **Concern:** Blockx retired in qualifying match vs Kubler - reason unclear

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread positions in same match are partially correlated
- If backing Blockx spread, slightly favors unders (dominant wins = fewer games)
- If backing Faria spread, slightly favors overs (closer match = more games)
