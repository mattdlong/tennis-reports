## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities (Estimated)

| Set Score | P(Potapova wins) | P(Lamens wins) |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 12% | 2% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 28% | 8% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 10% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 5% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 4% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.5 |
| **Market Line** | Not found |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | ~50% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | ~50% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (~73-76% estimated). Neither is a serve-dominant player with high double-fault rates (4+ per match for both). This suggests breaks will be common and sets won't drag to tiebreaks frequently.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low TB expectation (~15% for match). Potapova has 50% TB win rate on 106 career TBs, but with moderate hold rates, sets likely decided before 6-6.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** High probability (65%) of straight sets given Potapova's ranking advantage (#54 vs #95) and Lamens' dire 2026 form (0-3). Lamens averaged only 18.3 total games in her last 3 matches, losing by wide margins.

- **Form Differential:** Lamens' recent matches: 22, 17, 16 total games. This drag the expected total DOWN. Potapova's baseline is 22.09 games on hard court, but facing a struggling opponent likely means fewer games.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No totals betting line was found in market search. Additionally, specific hold % and break % data was not available for either player, limiting modeling confidence. The model estimate of 20.5 games is based on indirect indicators (break points per match, recent game counts) rather than direct hold/break percentages. Without a market line to compare, no edge can be calculated.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | N/A |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No game spread betting line was found in market search. The model projects Potapova -4.0 games based on form differential (Potapova 2-3 in 2026 vs Lamens 0-3), ranking gap (#54 vs #95), and Lamens' recent blowout losses (averaging only 6.3 games won per match in 2026). However, without market odds, no actionable edge can be identified.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** PASS - No market line available; insufficient hold/break data for confident modeling
- **Spread:** PASS - No market line available; form-based projection only
- **General:** Check sportsbooks directly (DraftKings, bet365, Pinnacle) closer to match time for lines

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Potapova has 50% TB win rate on good sample (106 TBs). However, with moderate hold rates expected, TB occurrence should be low (~15%).
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** HIGH - Specific hold % data not found. Estimates derived from break points faced/saved percentages.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** Potapova heavily favored (69.9% implied) and Lamens in terrible form. High probability of 2-0 result (65%), which caps total games.

### Data Limitations

- **Missing hold/break data:** Service games held % and return games won % not directly available for either player
- **No market lines:** Totals and spread odds not found in search
- **Limited recent sample:** Lamens only 3 matches in 2026, all losses
- **Tiebreak frequency unknown:** Could not find TB frequency for either player

### Correlation Notes

- If betting totals AND spread on same match, positions would be correlated
- Potapova straight sets victory = Under + Potapova covers likely correlated
- Lamens upset would likely produce higher total (3-set match)
