## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold/break rates: Baptiste 71.9% hold, Vondrousova 68.8% hold, Vondrousova 37.4% break

| Set Score | P(Baptiste wins) | P(Vondrousova wins) |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 8% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 8% | 22% |
| 6-4 | 10% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 12% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 7% | 5% |
| **Total Set Win** | 35% | 65% |

**Modeling Notes:**
- Vondrousova's superior break rate (37.4% vs ~30%) drives more decisive set scores
- Baptiste's higher hold (71.9% vs 68.8%) slightly favors tiebreaks when she's competitive
- Both players have lower hold rates than tour average, suggesting multiple breaks per set

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 48% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 52% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 22% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 5% |

**Analysis:**
- Low hold rates from both players reduce tiebreak probability
- Match likely to feature multiple breaks per set
- High probability of 3 sets due to Vondrousova's shoulder concern and Baptiste's fighting spirit
- Vondrousova's Brisbane loss (3 match points, still lost) suggests vulnerability to going long

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 8% | 8% |
| 19-20 games | 12% | 20% |
| 21-22 games | 20% | 40% |
| 23-24 games | 22% | 62% |
| 25-26 games | 18% | 80% |
| 27+ games | 20% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 23.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 20 - 28 |
| **Fair Line** | 23.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U ~24.5 (expert estimate) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 62% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 38% |
| **P(Over 24.5)** | 48% |
| **P(Under 24.5)** | 52% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have sub-75% hold rates on hard court (Baptiste 71.9%, Vondrousova 68.8%). This creates a break-heavy match profile. Lower hold rates typically mean more decisive games (6-3, 6-4 type sets) rather than tiebreaks.

- **Injury Factor (OVER):** Vondrousova's shoulder withdrawal from Adelaide is significant. Shoulder issues typically affect serve power and consistency first. If her serve is compromised, more breaks will occur, potentially extending sets. Her Brisbane match (38 games, 3 TBs) shows she can go long when struggling.

- **Three Sets Probability (OVER):** At 52% P(3 sets), the match has substantial probability of extra games. Baptiste's 31-game match at Hobart and Vondrousova's 38-game Brisbane loss both support extended match potential.

- **Tiebreak Probability (MODERATE):** At 22% for at least one TB, tiebreaks are not the primary driver here. The match will more likely be decided by breaks.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Vondrousova -3.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | Vondrousova -8 to Baptiste +2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Vondrousova -3.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Vondrousova Covers) | P(Baptiste Covers) | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Vondrousova -2.5 | 58% | 42% | Moderate edge |
| Vondrousova -3.5 | 52% | 48% | Near fair line |
| Vondrousova -4.5 | 44% | 56% | Baptiste value |
| Vondrousova -5.5 | 38% | 62% | Baptiste value |

**Analysis:**
- Wide confidence interval (-8 to +2) reflects high uncertainty
- Vondrousova's shoulder is the key variable
- If healthy: Vondrousova should cover -4.5 comfortably
- If compromised: Baptiste could push close or win outright
- Without market lines, cannot calculate actual edge

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | ~3.5 pp (estimated) |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have low hold rates (sub-72%), creating conditions for multiple breaks and competitive games. Vondrousova's shoulder concern adds uncertainty that typically extends matches - injured players often start well then fade, leading to 3-set matches. Baptiste's recent 31-game match and Vondrousova's 38-game Brisbane loss demonstrate both can participate in high-game-count matches.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No market spread lines available to calculate edge. Model suggests Vondrousova -3.2 fair line, but the shoulder injury creates binary risk that widens confidence intervals beyond acceptable levels. Without knowing if spread is -2.5 or -5.5, cannot make recommendation.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on spread:** No market line available; shoulder injury creates binary outcome risk
- **Pass on totals if:** Line moves to Under 21.5 (too much under value) or Over 26.5 (insufficient edge)
- **Live adjustment:** If Vondrousova shows visible discomfort, shift to stronger Over position

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Shoulder Injury (PRIMARY):** Vondrousova's Adelaide withdrawal is the dominant uncertainty. Shoulder injuries affect serve velocity and consistency. If compromised, expect more breaks. If she's recovered, could dominate quickly.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Both players' hold rates are based on limited 2026 sample. Baptiste's 4-match losing streak may indicate declining serve. Vondrousova's 2025 data may not reflect current post-injury state.

- **Tiebreak Variance:** Limited tiebreak data for Baptiste. Vondrousova's 75% TB win rate based on only 8 TBs - small sample.

### Data Limitations

- Baptiste's break % not directly available (estimated from BP conversion)
- Baptiste's tiebreak frequency not available
- No specific totals/spread market lines found
- Vondrousova's shoulder status unconfirmed for AO

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over correlates with 3-set match (both benefit from injury extending match)
- Would avoid pairing with Vondrousova ML given injury risk
- No known correlated positions
