## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities (Model Estimates)

| Set Score | P(Kypson wins) | P(Comesana wins) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 3% | 8% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 12% | 22% |
| 6-4 | 10% | 15% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 10% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 9% | 8% |

**Analysis:** Comesana's higher break % expectation against Kypson's moderate hold creates more scoring opportunities. The asymmetric skill gap (ATP regular vs Challenger graduate) suggests more dominant set scores likely.

### Match Structure (Best of 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 3-0) | 28% |
| P(4 Sets 3-1) | 38% |
| P(5 Sets 3-2) | 34% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 35% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 12% |

### Total Games Distribution (Bo5)

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤32 games | 15% | 15% |
| 33-36 | 22% | 37% |
| 37-40 | 28% | 65% |
| 41-44 | 20% | 85% |
| 45+ | 15% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 38.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 32 - 44 |
| **Fair Line** | 38.2 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 39.5 |
| **P(Over 39.5)** | 42% |
| **P(Under 39.5)** | 58% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Kypson holds at 86%, but Comesana's estimated 65% hold is concerning. When one player struggles on serve (65% vs 86%), expect more breaks and shorter sets (6-3, 6-4 type scores rather than tiebreaks).

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With asymmetric hold rates, tiebreak probability per set is moderate (~18%). Kypson's strong TB record (65%) won't boost totals if sets don't reach 6-6.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 28% probability of 3-0 result. Comesana's ATP experience edge and Kypson's recent form dip (1-2 in 2026) suggest potential for dominant scorelines.

- **Surface Context:** Medium-fast hard court at Australian Open favors Comesana's ATP-level baseline game. Kypson's Challenger success may not immediately translate.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Comesana -4.1 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -10 to +2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Comesana -4.1 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Comesana Covers) | P(Kypson Covers) | Edge |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------|
| Comesana -2.5 | 62% | 38% | +4.5 pp |
| Comesana -3.5 | 58% | 42% | +2.8 pp |
| Comesana -4.5 | 48% | 52% | -2.0 pp |
| Comesana -5.5 | 42% | 58% | -4.5 pp |

**Analysis:** Comesana's ranking edge (#68 vs #116) and ATP experience suggest a margin of ~4 games. The -3.5 line offers value as the model projects 58% coverage probability.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 38.2 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Betwinner/Melbet | O/U 39.5 | 53.8% | 51.3% | 5.1% | Under +3.2 pp |
| Bet365/888Starz | O/U 40.5 | 54.6% | 54.6% | 9.2% | Under +5.5 pp |

**Analysis:** Market line at 39.5 implies the market expects a competitive match. Our model suggests 38.2 expected games based on hold/break asymmetry. The 40.5 line offers even more value for under, but 39.5 is the sharper line.

### Game Spread

| Source | Line | Fav | Dog | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Model | Comesana -4.1 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Market | Comesana -3.5 | ~54% | ~54% | ~8% | +2.8 pp |

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 39.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** The hold rate differential (Kypson 86% vs Comesana ~65%) creates asymmetric break opportunities. When one player has significantly weaker hold, sets tend toward 6-3/6-4 scorelines rather than tiebreaks. The 28% straight sets probability further supports under. Kypson's recent struggles (1-2 in 2026) against ATP-level opposition reinforce the potential for shorter sets.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Comesana -3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Comesana's ATP experience edge (beat Zverev, Rublev at tour level) versus Kypson's Challenger background suggests a skill gap. The model projects a 4.1 game margin, making -3.5 attractive. Comesana's 42% break point conversion is elite and should exploit Kypson's serve at the Grand Slam stage.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Line moves to 38.5 or below; Kypson form improves dramatically pre-match
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line moves to -5.5 or beyond; Weather delays cause extended breaks
- **General Pass:** If either player shows injury concerns in warm-up

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Best of 5 Format:** Grand Slam format adds significant variance. One dominant set can shift totals dramatically. The 95% CI of 32-44 games reflects this uncertainty.

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If Kypson's serve clicks at the Grand Slam stage, TB probability increases, potentially pushing over. His recent 65% TB win rate is a small sample.

- **Transition Factor:** Kypson's Challenger-to-Grand Slam transition is uncertain. Some players rise to the occasion; others struggle with the atmosphere and surface pace.

### Data Limitations

- **Comesana Hold/Break:** Estimated at ~65%, not directly confirmed. His 82% "service game defense" stat from one source conflicts with ATP averages.
- **Tiebreak Sample:** Kypson's TB stats are based on 26 recent TBs (adequate). Comesana's TB data unavailable.
- **Surface-Specific Stats:** Neither player has extensive hard court hold/break data from 2026.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Under 39.5 and Comesana -3.5 are positively correlated. A 3-0 Comesana win would likely hit both. Consider combined exposure (max 3.0 units on correlated positions).
