## Executive Summary

### Totals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Model Fair Line** | 36.8 games (95% CI: 31-43) |
| **Market Line** | O/U 35.5 |
| **Lean** | Over 35.5 |
| **Edge** | 3.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

### Game Spread

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Model Fair Line** | Bublik -5.2 games (95% CI: -1 to -12) |
| **Market Line** | Bublik -6.5 |
| **Lean** | Brooksby +6.5 |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |

## Alexander Bublik - Hold/Break Profile

| Category | Stat | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Hold %** | Service Games Held | 85% (hard court, 2025) |
| **Break %** | Return Games Won | 24.7% |

| **Tiebreak** | TB Frequency | ~20-25% |
| | TB Win Rate | 100% (n=2 in 2026) |

| **Game Distribution** | Avg Total Games/Match | 21.75 (last 4, BO3) |
| | Avg Games Won | 13.25 (last 4) |
| | Straight Sets Win % | 75% (last 4) |

| **Serve** | 1st In % | 62% |
| | Aces/Match | 11.25 |

| | DFs/Match | 4.67 |
| | Service Pts Won % | 66% |

| **Return** | Break Pts Converted | 41% |
| | Breaks/Match | 1.98 |
| **Load** | Rest / Sets Last 7d | 6 days / 9 sets |

**Notes:** Bublik enters in peak form after winning Hong Kong. His serve is high-variance: league-leading ace count but prone to double faults under pressure. The 85% hold rate is elite, but the high DF rate creates break opportunities in key moments.

## Jenson Brooksby - Hold/Break Profile

| Category | Stat | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Hold %** | Service Games Held | 72% (hard court) |
| **Break %** | Return Games Won | 24.7% |

| **Tiebreak** | TB Frequency | ~15-20% |
| | TB Win Rate | Strong in clutch (limited sample) |

| **Game Distribution** | Avg Total Games/Match | 18.5 (last 2, BO3) |
| | Avg Games Won | 8.5 (last 2) |
| | Straight Sets Win % | 50% (last 2) |

| **Serve** | 1st In % | 62.7% |
| | Aces/Match | 2.72 |

| | DFs/Match | 2.34 |
| | Break Pts Converted | 43.3% |
| **Return** | Breaks/Match | 3.03 |
| **Load** | Rest / Sets Last 7d | 4 days / 4 sets |

**Notes:** Brooksby's unorthodox "junk-ball" style extends rallies and creates unpredictable game patterns. Lower hold rate (72%) makes him vulnerable on serve, but his return game is solid. Coming back from a 2-year wrist injury layoff (2023-2024) - fitness over 5 sets is a question mark.

## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold/break differentials (Bublik 85% hold / Brooksby 72% hold):

| Set Score | P(Bublik wins) | P(Brooksby wins) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 1% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 28% | 6% |
| 6-4 | 22% | 10% |
| 7-5 | 12% | 8% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 10% | 5% |
| **Subtotal** | 80% | 30% |

*Note: Rows don't sum to 100% as these are per-set probabilities across different set outcomes.*

### Match Structure (Best of 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Bublik 3-0) | 35% |
| P(Bublik 3-1) | 32% |
| P(Bublik 3-2) | 12% |
| P(Brooksby 3-0) | 3% |
| P(Brooksby 3-1) | 8% |
| P(Brooksby 3-2) | 10% |
| **P(At Least 1 TB)** | 40% |
| **P(2+ TBs)** | 12% |

### Total Games Distribution (Best of 5)

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤30 games | 12% | 12% |
| 31-34 | 22% | 34% |
| 35-38 | 30% | 64% |
| 39-42 | 22% | 86% |
| 43+ | 14% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 36.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 31 - 43 |
| **Fair Line** | 36.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 35.5 |
| **P(Over 35.5)** | 58% |
| **P(Under 35.5)** | 42% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Bublik's elite 85% hold rate suggests fewer breaks, but Brooksby's 72% hold creates break opportunities. The asymmetry (85% vs 72%) typically leads to competitive but decisive sets (6-4, 6-3 patterns).

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With Bublik's big serve, P(at least 1 TB) = 40%. Each TB adds 13 games minimum to that set. This pushes expected total higher.

- **Best of 5 Format:** The Grand Slam format increases total games substantially. Even a 3-0 result averages ~30 games; 4-5 set matches can reach 45+.

- **Brooksby's Style:** His defensive counterpunching style tends to extend rallies and deuce games, adding to total even in losing sets.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Bublik -5.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -12 |
| **Fair Spread** | Bublik -5.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Bublik Covers) | P(Brooksby Covers) | Edge |
|------|------------------|---------------------|------|
| Bublik -3.5 | 68% | 32% | - |
| Bublik -4.5 | 60% | 40% | - |
| Bublik -5.5 | 48% | 52% | - |
| **Bublik -6.5** | 43% | 57% | **2.8 pp** |
| Bublik -7.5 | 35% | 65% | - |

**Analysis:** Market line of -6.5 appears slightly too wide given our model's fair spread of -5.2. While Bublik is clearly the better player, Brooksby's ability to steal sets (10% chance of winning 3-2) and his competitive nature in losing sets (often losing 6-4 rather than 6-2) provides cover value.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 17 |
| Avg Game Margin | 7 (Brooksby favor) |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | N/A (BO3) |

**Previous Meeting:** Montreal 2022 - Brooksby def. Bublik 6-2, 6-3

**Sample Size Warning:** Single H2H match from 2022 is not predictive. Bublik has transformed his game significantly since then, winning 5 titles in the last 8 months. This H2H should be largely discounted.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 35.5 |
| **Target Price** | -115 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Best-of-5 format inherently pushes totals higher. Model projects 36.8 expected games based on Bublik's 85% hold rate (creates TB potential) and Brooksby's competitive style that extends sets even in losses. The 40% tiebreak probability is a key driver - each TB adds significant games. Market at 35.5 underestimates game count.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Brooksby +6.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model fair spread of Bublik -5.2 suggests the market's -6.5 line is too wide. While Bublik should win comfortably (79% ML implied), Brooksby's counterpunching style keeps sets competitive (more 6-4 than 6-2 losses). His 10% upset probability in 5-setter format also helps cover.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on Over if line moves to 37.5 or higher
- Pass on Brooksby +6.5 if line tightens to +5.5 or lower
- Pass on Bublik -6.5 (no edge on favorite side)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Model assumes 40% TB probability, but Bublik's serve is high-variance. Could see 0 TBs or 3+ TBs significantly impacting total.
- **Brooksby's Fitness:** Returning from 2-year injury layoff. Unclear how he handles 5-set format - could retire if match extends, impacting both totals and spread.
- **Bublik Serve Volatility:** His 4.67 DF/match rate creates uncertainty. Hot serving = blowout (Under, big spread); cold serving = competitive sets (Over, small margin).

### Data Limitations

- Specific totals and spread odds not obtained (site restrictions)
- Tiebreak sample size for 2026 is only 2 TBs for Bublik
- Limited recent BO5 data for both players (most recent matches were BO3)

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Brooksby +6.5 have slight positive correlation (extended matches help both)
- Combined stake of 1.5 units if taking both is acceptable given low correlation
