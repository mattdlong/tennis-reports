### Market Comparison (19.5 Line)

| Source | Over Odds | Under Odds | Implied Over% | Implied Under% | Vig |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Model | - | - | 46% | 54% | 0% |
| Betting Expert | 1.73 | 2.20 | 57.8% | 45.5% | 3.3% |
| **No-Vig** | - | - | 56.0% | 44.0% | - |

### Edge Calculation
- Model P(Under 19.5): 54%
- Market No-Vig P(Under 19.5): 44%
- **Edge: +10.0 pp raw → adjusted for uncertainty: ~3.7 pp**

### Factors Driving Total:

**Favoring Under:**
1. **High hold differential (+12.2%)** - Alexandrova should dominate service games
2. **Sonmez's low hold % (61.6%)** - Vulnerable to multiple breaks per set
3. **Expert consensus: 2-0** - Multiple sources predict straight sets
4. **68% straight sets probability** - Fewer games in 2-set matches
5. **H2H precedent** - 21 games on grass (6-3, 7-6) but hard court favors faster results

**Favoring Over:**
1. Alexandrova's poor 2026 form (1-2) - may struggle early
2. Sonmez's momentum (4-0 in qualifying)
3. Tiebreak potential if Alexandrova goes cold (lost 2 TBs to Raducanu at AO 2025)

## 6. Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Alexandrova -4.8 games |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -9 games |
| **Fair Spread** | Alexandrova -4.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Alexandrova -4.5 | 55% | 45% | **2.8 pp** |

### H2H Margin Reference
- Wimbledon 2025: Alexandrova won 6-3, 7-6(1) → **margin of +4 games**
- On grass (slower than hard) - expect similar or larger margin on hard

### Handicap Factors:

**Favoring Alexandrova covers (-4.5):**
1. Hold rate advantage creates consistent pressure
2. Sonmez unlikely to hold serve against quality opponent
3. Power differential (22 winners vs 13 at Wimbledon)
4. Ranking gap (#11 vs #112) historically correlates with margin

**Favoring Sonmez covers (+4.5):**
1. Alexandrova's early season form concerns
2. Sonmez playing well, full of confidence
3. New coaching team (Jabeur/Jellali) may help
4. H2H only showed +4 margin on grass

## 9. Recommendations

### TOTALS RECOMMENDATION

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | **Under 19.5** |
| **Target Price** | 2.00 or better (current 2.20) |
| **Edge** | 3.7 pp |
| **Confidence** | **MEDIUM** |
| **Stake** | **1.0 units** |

**Rationale:** The 12.2% hold rate differential strongly favors Alexandrova dominating. Sonmez's 61.6% hold % means multiple breaks per set are likely. With 68% straight sets probability and expert consensus on 2-0, the under is the value side. The market has over-priced the over due to tiebreak fear, but Alexandrova dominated the only TB they played 7-1.

### GAME SPREAD RECOMMENDATION

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | **Alexandrova -4.5** |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | **LOW** |
| **Stake** | **0.5 units** |

**Rationale:** Model projects -4.8 game margin, making -4.5 the value side. However, confidence is low due to Alexandrova's poor early-season form and Sonmez's momentum. The H2H margin was exactly +4 on grass, which should be similar or better on hard. Take small position.

### Pass Conditions:
- **Pass on Totals if:** Line moves to 20.5 or higher (edge disappears)
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line moves to -5.5 (model shows negative edge)
- **Pass on Both if:** Alexandrova shows injury/fitness concerns pre-match

## 10. Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers:
- **Tiebreak volatility** - Alexandrova's TB record is mixed (1-2 third-set TBs), but dominated Sonmez 7-1
- **Hold rate uncertainty** - First hard court meeting; stats from mixed surfaces
- **Form trajectory** - Alexandrova trending down, Sonmez trending up

### Data Limitations:
- No specific hard court hold % for Sonmez
- Sonmez tiebreak sample size too small for reliable modeling
- Average games/match data extrapolated from limited sources
- Spread odds not available at time of analysis

### Correlation Considerations:
- Under 19.5 and Alexandrova -4.5 are **positively correlated**
- If playing both, reduce stakes slightly to manage exposure
- Combined max: 1.5 units total (vs 1.5 units individual)
