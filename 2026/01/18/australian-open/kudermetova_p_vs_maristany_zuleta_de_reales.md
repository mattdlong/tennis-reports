## 9. Recommendations

### Totals

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Insufficient data |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Cannot calculate edge without market lines. Model suggests fair line around 20.5 with slight Under lean due to expected Kudermetova dominance. Revisit when lines are posted.

### Game Spread

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Insufficient data |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model fair line at Kudermetova -4.5. If market posts -5.5 or higher, Maristany +5.5 becomes interesting. If market posts -3.5 or lower, Kudermetova covers. Cannot recommend without posted lines.

### Conditional Plays (If Lines Post)

| Condition | Play | Confidence |
|-----------|------|------------|
| If O/U line ≤ 19.5 | Consider Over | LOW |
| If O/U line ≥ 22.5 | Consider Under | LOW |
| If spread ≤ -3.5 | Consider Kudermetova covers | LOW |
| If spread ≥ -5.5 | Consider Maristany covers | LOW |

## 10. Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers
- **Kudermetova DFs:** 4.33/match average creates serving instability
- **Maristany Fight:** Showed resilience in qualifying 3-setters
- **Fatigue Unknown:** Maristany's physical state after 3 qualifying matches
- **Tiebreak Sample:** Limited data for both players

### Data Limitations
- **Hold/Break Stats:** Exact percentages unavailable from public sources
- **Surface Adjustment:** Maristany has limited hard court sample
- **Betting Lines:** Totals and spreads not yet posted
- **Tiebreak Records:** Incomplete data

### Model Uncertainty
Wide confidence intervals (17-25 total games, -8 to +1 margin) reflect:
- Estimated hold/break rather than confirmed stats
- Maristany's limited hard court history
- First meeting between players
