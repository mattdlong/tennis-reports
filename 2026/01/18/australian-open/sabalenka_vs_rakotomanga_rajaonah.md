## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Sabalenka wins) | P(Rakotomanga wins) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 35% | <1% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 45% | <1% |
| 6-4 | 12% | 2% |
| 7-5 | 4% | 1% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 2% | <1% |

**Key Insight:** Combined 80% probability of Sabalenka winning sets by margins of 6-0 to 6-3. Tiebreak probability extremely low given hold rate differential.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 92% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 7% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 5% |
| P(2+ TBs) | <1% |

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤14 games | 25% | 25% |
| 15-16 | 35% | 60% |
| 17-18 | 20% | 80% |
| 19-20 | 10% | 90% |
| 21+ | 10% | 100% |

**Most Likely Scorelines:** 6-1, 6-2 (14 games) or 6-2, 6-2 (16 games)

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 16.0 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 13 - 19 |
| **Fair Line** | 16.0 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 19.5 |
| **P(Over 19.5)** | 10% |
| **P(Under 19.5)** | 90% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Differential:** Sabalenka holds at 80.4% while Rakotomanga Rajaonah holds at just 63.9%. This massive gap (16.5 pp) means Sabalenka will break frequently (expected 2-3 breaks per set) while holding almost all her service games.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Essentially zero. For a tiebreak to occur, Rakotomanga Rajaonah would need to hold enough games to reach 6-6. Given her hold rate against an elite returner, probability is <5%.

- **Straight Sets Certainty:** 92% probability of straight sets victory. Even in the unlikely 3-set scenario, the third set would likely be short.

- **Brisbane Form:** Sabalenka averaged just 11.4 total games across 5 matches, including 7 games vs Bucsa (6-0, 6-1). This opponent is weaker than any Brisbane opponent.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Sabalenka -8.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -12 to -5 |
| **Fair Spread** | Sabalenka -8.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Sabalenka Covers) | P(Rakotomanga Covers) | Edge |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|------|
| Sabalenka -6.5 | 75% | 25% | 25 pp |
| Sabalenka -7.5 | 68% | 32% | 18 pp |
| Sabalenka -8.5 | 56% | 44% | 6 pp |
| Sabalenka -9.5 | 45% | 55% | -5 pp |
| Sabalenka -10.5 | 35% | 65% | -15 pp |

**Key Finding:** Model fair spread is -8.5. If market offers -8.5 at even odds, edge is approximately 6 pp. Avoid -10.5 or higher spreads.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 16.0 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Market | O/U 19.5 | ~50% | ~50% | ~5% | **10.5 pp (Under)** |

**Analysis:** Market line of 19.5 is 3.5 games above model fair value. Even accounting for vig and uncertainty, Under 19.5 shows substantial edge.

### Game Spread

| Source | Line | Fav | Dog | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Model | Sab -8.5 | 56% | 44% | 0% | - |
| Market Est. | Sab -8.5 to -10.5 | ~50% | ~50% | ~5% | **6 pp (at -8.5)** |

**Analysis:** If spread available at -8.5, model shows ~6 pp edge. Avoid -10.5 or steeper lines where edge evaporates or goes negative.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | **Under 19.5** |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 10.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | HIGH |
| **Stake** | 2.0 units |

**Rationale:** Massive hold/break differential predicts a short match. Sabalenka's 80.4% hold rate combined with her 40.4% break rate against a player holding only 63.9% of service games means rapid service breaks. Brisbane form (11.4 avg games/match) confirms dominance pattern. 90% model probability for Under 19.5 vs ~50% implied market probability creates substantial edge.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | **Sabalenka -8.5** |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 6.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | HIGH |
| **Stake** | 1.5 units |

**Rationale:** Expected margin of -8.5 games aligns with projected scoreline of 6-1, 6-2 or 6-2, 6-2. Sabalenka's Brisbane results (-8.2 average margin) support this projection. Avoid steeper spreads (-10.5+) where coverage requires near-perfect domination.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on totals if:** Line moves to Under 17.5 or lower (edge erodes)
- **Pass on spread if:** Line moves to -10.5 or steeper (coverage probability drops below 45%)
- **General pass:** If retirement/injury news emerges pre-match

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Retirement Risk:** In extreme blowouts (6-0, 5-0), retirement possibility increases. This would void most spread bets depending on book rules. Confirm book rules on retirements.

- **Mental Reset:** Lower-ranked players sometimes find their level after losing first set badly. If Rakotomanga Rajaonah competes harder in set 2, could add 2-3 games.

- **Weather Delays:** Outdoor night session in Melbourne summer. Unlikely but possible delays could affect player rhythm.

### Data Limitations

- **Rakotomanga Rajaonah data sparse:** Limited advanced statistics available. Hold % estimate (63.9%) based on limited sample against non-elite competition.

- **No elite opposition data:** Rakotomanga Rajaonah has never faced a top-10 player. Actual performance against Sabalenka could be worse than model suggests.

- **Tiebreak data missing:** No TB statistics for Rakotomanga Rajaonah, though this is largely irrelevant given TB probability <5%.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals and spread are correlated:** Both bets benefit from Sabalenka domination. If taking both, consider reducing combined stake.

- **No other positions:** First match of tournament; no existing exposure.
