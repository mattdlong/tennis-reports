| P(Cerundolo 3-0) | 32% |
| P(Cerundolo 3-1) | 28% |
| P(Cerundolo 3-2) | 12% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 36.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 31 - 43 games |
| **Fair Line** | 36.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 35.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 35.5)** | 58% |
| **P(Under 35.5)** | 42% |

### Model Calculation

**Straight Sets (3-0) Scenario:**
- P(3-0 Cerundolo): 32% x avg 27 games = 8.6 weighted games
- P(3-0 Zhang): 5% x avg 28 games = 1.4 weighted games

**Four Sets (3-1) Scenario:**
- P(3-1 Cerundolo): 28% x avg 36 games = 10.1 weighted games
- P(3-1 Zhang): 10% x avg 37 games = 3.7 weighted games

**Five Sets (3-2) Scenario:**
- P(3-2 Either): 25% x avg 45 games = 11.3 weighted games

**Expected Total:** 8.6 + 1.4 + 10.1 + 3.7 + 11.3 + TB adjustment (1.7) = **36.8 games**

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Cerundolo's 78% hold vs Zhang's 75% hold suggests competitive sets. Neither is a dominant server, but both are competent enough to avoid frequent bagels.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Zhang has shown high TB tendency recently (2 TBs each in wins vs Bergs and Bu). Combined with moderate hold rates, ~45% chance of at least 1 TB adds ~1.5-2 games to expected total.

- **Set Count Impact:** Market expects 3-4 sets (U4.5 sets at 1.33). Our model sees 63% chance of 4+ sets, driving total higher than typical 3-0 scenario would suggest.

- **Cerundolo's Return Ability:** As #4 ATP returner with 34% break rate, Cerundolo will generate break opportunities, but Zhang's 64.86% BP saved rate could lead to extended deuce games.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Cerundolo -5.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -10 games |
| **Fair Spread** | Cerundolo -5.2 |

### Model Calculation

**By Match Outcome:**
- Cerundolo 3-0 (32%): Avg margin -9 games
- Cerundolo 3-1 (28%): Avg margin -6 games
- Cerundolo 3-2 (12%): Avg margin -2 games
- Zhang 3-2 (13%): Avg margin +2 games
- Zhang 3-1 (10%): Avg margin +6 games
- Zhang 3-0 (5%): Avg margin +9 games

**Weighted Expected Margin:**
(0.32 x -9) + (0.28 x -6) + (0.12 x -2) + (0.13 x +2) + (0.10 x +6) + (0.05 x +9) = **-5.2 games**

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Cerundolo Covers) | P(Zhang Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cerundolo -2.5 | 68% | 32% | +3.0 pp |
| Cerundolo -3.5 | 62% | 38% | +2.8 pp |
| Cerundolo -4.5 | 56% | 44% | +2.8 pp |
| Cerundolo -5.5 | 48% | 52% | -1.5 pp |
| Cerundolo -6.5 | 40% | 60% | -4.5 pp |

**Best Value:** Cerundolo -4.5 with ~56% coverage probability vs typical market pricing around 52-53%

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 3 |
| H2H Record | Zhang leads 2-1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 24.0 |
| Avg Game Margin | +1.3 (Zhang favor) |
| TBs in H2H | 2 (both in 2021 Wimbledon Q) |
| 3-Setters in H2H (Bo3) | 2/3 matches |

### H2H Detail

| Date | Event | Surface | Result | Games | TBs |
|------|-------|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| 2023 | Eastbourne | Grass | Cerundolo 6-2, 6-3 | 17 | 0 |
| 2021 | Wimbledon Q | Grass | Zhang 6-0, 6-3, 6-7(4), 7-6(6) | 35 | 2 |
| 2019 | Columbus CH | Hard | Zhang 6-4, 6-4 | 20 | 0 |

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 3 H2H matches, 2 on grass, 1 on hard (7 years ago). Limited predictive value. Most recent hard court meeting was 2019 when both players were significantly different.

## Market Comparison

### Set Betting Market (Implied Probabilities)

| Outcome | Odds | Implied % | Model % | Diff |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|------|
| Cerundolo 3-0 | 2.25 | 44% | 32% | -12% |
| Cerundolo 3-1 | 4.00 | 25% | 28% | +3% |
| Cerundolo 3-2 | 6.00 | 17% | 12% | -5% |
| Zhang 3-0 | 11.00 | 9% | 5% | -4% |
| Zhang 3-1 | 8.00 | 13% | 10% | -3% |
| Zhang 3-2 | 9.00 | 11% | 13% | +2% |

*Note: Implied probabilities sum to 119% due to vig*

### Total Sets Market

| Line | Odds | Implied % (No-Vig) | Model % | Edge |
|------|------|-------------------|---------|------|
| Under 4.5 sets | 1.33 | 63% | 37% | -26% (avoid) |
| Over 4.5 sets | 3.75 | 37% | 63% | +26% (value) |
| Under 3.5 sets | 1.52 | 52% | 37% | -15% |
| Over 3.5 sets | 2.63 | 48% | 63% | +15% |

**Key Insight:** Market significantly underpricing the probability of 4+ sets. Over 3.5 sets at 2.63 offers substantial value if our model is correct.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 35.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.75 units |

**Rationale:** The 63% probability of 4+ sets is the primary driver. Cerundolo's elite return game (34% break rate, #4 ATP) combined with Zhang's recent high-TB tendency and moderate hold rates suggest extended sets. Zhang's United Cup win vs Bergs (38 games, 2 TBs, zero break points faced) demonstrates his ceiling. However, confidence is LOW due to Zhang's injury uncertainty and limited recent data.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Cerundolo -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model expects Cerundolo -5.2 game margin. At -4.5 market line, there's approximately 56% coverage probability. Cerundolo's ranking (20 vs 362), superior 2025 record (38-25 vs 5-12), and hard court form (60% vs 25%) support the favorite spread. However, Zhang's unpredictable post-injury form caps confidence.

### Alternative Play: Over 3.5 Sets

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Sets |
| **Selection** | Over 3.5 sets |
| **Target Price** | 2.50 or better |
| **Edge** | ~15 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** At 2.63 odds (38% implied), market significantly underprices the 63% probability of 4+ sets. This is the highest-edge play on the match if the line holds.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Line moves to 37.5 or higher (edge drops below 2.5%)
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line moves to Cerundolo -6.5 or higher (model favors Zhang coverage)
- **General Pass if:** Zhang shows significant physical limitations in warm-up or early match

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Zhang's Injury Return:** Six-month shoulder injury with completely altered forehand technique is the primary unknown. Could result in either a blowout loss (low total) or extended competitive match if the new technique holds.

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Zhang's recent high-TB tendency (2 TBs each in wins vs Bergs and Bu) could significantly inflate totals if pattern continues, or deflate if he can't sustain serve level.

- **Fitness Uncertainty (Bo5):** Zhang hasn't played a Bo5 match since returning from injury. Stamina is a major unknown, particularly in Melbourne heat.

### Data Limitations

- **Zhang's Post-Injury Stats:** Only 2 wins in 7 matches since return, limited sample for hold/break estimation
- **Tiebreak Sample:** Zhang's TB win rate unknown; Cerundolo's 54% based on solid 168 TB sample
- **Surface-Specific:** Most H2H on grass (2/3 matches); 2019 hard court data is outdated

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Cerundolo -4.5 have positive correlation (~0.4): If match goes 4+ sets, Cerundolo more likely to cover spread
- Consider reducing combined stake if playing both markets
