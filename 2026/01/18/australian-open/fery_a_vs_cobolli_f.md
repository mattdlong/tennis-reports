## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 35.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 29 - 41 |
| **Fair Line** | 35.2 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 38.5 |
| **P(Over 38.5)** | 35% |
| **P(Under 38.5)** | 65% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (Fery ~77%, Cobolli ~65% on hard). Cobolli's lower hold suggests more break opportunities, but also faster set completions. Combined, this points to medium-low game counts per set.

- **Straight Sets Probability:** Cobolli is heavy favorite (66% implied). Model projects 57% chance of Cobolli 3-0 or 3-1. Fery's qualifying dominance (16.3 avg games in Bo3) suggests he can be broken down by higher-level opposition.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Cobolli's recent tiebreak frequency inflates his game counts, but against a player he should dominate, fewer close sets expected. Estimated 42% chance of at least 1 TB across 3-4 sets.

- **Competition Level Jump:** Fery's low game counts came against qualifiers ranked 200+. Cobolli, despite hard court struggles, is a top-25 player. Market line of 38.5 assumes a competitive 4-setter; model sees more 3-0/3-1 outcomes with shorter sets.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 38.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects 35.2 total games based on Cobolli's moderate hold rate and likely dominance against a qualifier. Fery's AO qualifying matches averaged only 16.3 games against weaker opposition, and while ATP-level competition will be tougher, he's unlikely to push Cobolli to multiple close sets. The 57% probability of a 3-0 or 3-1 finish supports the under.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Cobolli -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects Cobolli -5.1 games, giving slight edge at -4.5. However, wide confidence interval (-12 to +2) reflects Bo5 variance and uncertainty about Fery's true ATP-level quality. Cobolli's hard court struggles add risk. Smaller stake warranted.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Line moves to 37.5 or below, or odds drop below 1.80
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line moves to -5.5 or higher
- **Both markets:** Pass if injury news emerges affecting either player's stamina

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If Cobolli plays to his 2026 pattern (4 TBs in 2 matches), game count could inflate significantly. However, against a lower-ranked opponent he should dominate, reducing close-set probability.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Fery's ATP-level hold rate is estimated. If he serves better than expected, sets will go longer. If worse, blowouts likely (supports under either way).

- **Bo5 Format:** Five-set format increases variance. A 5-set match would blow through the over; model assigns this low probability given skill gap.

### Data Limitations

- **Fery ATP Hold/Break:** No significant ATP sample; estimates from Challenger and qualifying data
- **Cobolli Hard Court Form:** 2025 hard court record (37%) may not reflect current ability
- **Tiebreak Sample:** Fery's 33 TBs is adequate but not ideal

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Moderate positive correlation. A blowout (Cobolli covers big) supports the under. A competitive 5-setter would see both bets lose. Sizing both modestly at combined 1.5 units.
