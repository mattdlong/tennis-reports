## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Danilovic wins) | P(Williams wins) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 12% | 2% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 28% | 6% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 8% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 5% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 7% | 6% |

**Methodology:** Based on Danilovic 69.6% hold, 28.6% break vs estimated Williams 60% hold, 30% break. Williams' high DF rate (5.5/match) and low first serve % (54%) significantly reduces her expected hold rate.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 68% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 32% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 22% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 5% |

**Analysis:** With Williams struggling to hold serve consistently and Danilovic being a moderate server/returner, breaks are expected to occur frequently. This reduces tiebreak probability and increases straight sets likelihood.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 18% | 18% |
| 19-20 | 22% | 40% |
| 21-22 | 25% | 65% |
| 23-24 | 18% | 83% |
| 25-26 | 10% | 93% |
| 27+ | 7% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 21.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 18 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | 21.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 47% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 53% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have below-average hold rates (Danilovic 69.6%, Williams ~60%). This creates break opportunities and shorter sets on average. Neither player is a hold-dominant server who would push sets to tiebreaks.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low TB probability (~22% for at least one TB) due to moderate-low hold rates. This reduces the high-end tail of the game distribution (no 7-6 sets likely).

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 68% probability of straight sets significantly caps total games. If Danilovic dominates as expected, we could see 6-3 6-3 or 6-4 6-2 type scores (18-21 games).

- **Williams Serve Vulnerability:** Her 5.5 DFs/match and 54% first serve in creates significant service game vulnerability. This compresses match length.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Danilovic -4.6 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -9 |
| **Fair Spread** | Danilovic -4.6 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Danilovic Covers) | P(Williams Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|----|
| Danilovic -2.5 | 68% | 32% | +4.8 pp |
| Danilovic -3.5 | 58% | 42% | +2.8 pp |
| Danilovic -4.5 | 48% | 52% | -1.2 pp |
| Danilovic -5.5 | 38% | 62% | -4.2 pp |

**Analysis:** Market line of -3.5 appears fair to slightly favorable for Danilovic cover. With 58% model probability at -3.5 against an implied 50% (standard -110/-110), there is approximately 2.8 pp edge.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Williams' serve vulnerability (60% estimated hold, 5.5 DFs/match, 54% first serve in) combined with Danilovic's break ability (28.6%) creates conditions for shorter sets. The 68% straight sets probability caps total games. Neither player has serve weapons to consistently push to tiebreaks, removing high-end variance. Model fair line of 21.8 games with 53% Under probability provides 3.2 pp edge at standard -110 pricing.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Danilovic -3.5 |
| **Target Price** | -110 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model fair spread of Danilovic -4.6 games exceeds market line of -3.5, providing 2.8 pp edge. Danilovic's superior ranking (#68 vs #576), better hold rate, and Williams' serve struggles support a comfortable margin. However, edge is near threshold (2.5%) and Danilovic's recent loss to Ruzic (3-6 3-6) raises consistency concerns.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Over 21.5:** Edge favors Under; Over has negative expected value
- **Pass if line moves to -4.5 or higher:** Model shows Danilovic covers -4.5 only 48% of the time
- **Pass if totals line moves to 20.5:** Under becomes less attractive at lower line
- **Monitor for retirement risk:** Williams' age (45) and recent struggles could lead to retirement, voiding some bets

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If both players hold better than expected, tiebreaks could push total over. However, underlying hold rates suggest this is unlikely.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Williams' hold rate estimated from limited 2026 data. Actual hold could be higher (experience) or lower (physical decline).
- **Straight Sets Risk:** 68% straight sets probability is key driver. If Danilovic dominates (75%+ straight sets), Under clears easily. If match goes 3 sets (32%), Under likely fails.

### Data Limitations

- **Venus Williams hold/break data incomplete:** Using estimates based on limited 2026 sample and contextual indicators (high DF rate, low first serve %)
- **Danilovic tiebreak sample small:** Only 12 TBs in sample, 41.7% win rate may not be reliable
- **No H2H data:** First meeting means no historical game count reference
- **Specific totals/spread odds not collected:** Using assumed standard pricing

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals and spread have low correlation:** Under bet wins regardless of which player wins; spread bet requires Danilovic margin
- **Consider position sizing:** If taking both bets, total exposure 1.5 units (within 3.0 unit combined max)
- **Retirement hedge:** If Williams retires, some books void totals but grade spreads. Check book rules before betting.
