## Game Distribution Analysis

### Estimated Set Score Probabilities

**WARNING: These are rough estimates based on recent results, NOT proper hold/break modeling.**

| Set Score | P(Houkes wins) | P(Visker wins) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | ~10% | ~2% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | ~35% | ~8% |
| 6-4 | ~25% | ~12% |
| 7-5 | ~10% | ~8% |
| 7-6 (TB) | ~8% | ~6% |

*Estimates based on ranking differential and recent form, with significant uncertainty.*

### Match Structure (Estimated)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | ~70% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | ~30% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | ~20% |
| P(2+ TBs) | ~5% |

### Total Games Distribution (Estimated)

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | ~25% | 25% |
| 19-20 | ~25% | 50% |
| 21-22 | ~20% | 70% |
| 23-24 | ~15% | 85% |
| 25+ | ~15% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | ~21 (estimate) |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | ~21 |
| **Market Line** | **Not Available** |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | ~45% (estimate) |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | ~55% (estimate) |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Unknown - critical data missing. Houkes' straight sets dominance at this event suggests he may break serve frequently against lower-ranked opponents.
- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low-moderate (~20%). Houkes had only 1 TB in 4 matches. Visker had 3 TBs in 4 matches, but against different level opponents.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** High (70%). Houkes has won all 4 matches in straight sets, with efficient scorelines (avg 19.5 games).

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Without hold/break percentages, cannot properly model expected games per set.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | **PASS** |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate - no market |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** PASS on totals due to (1) missing hold/break percentages making proper modeling impossible, and (2) no totals market available for this ITF M25 event. The recent game counts suggest a fair line around 21 games, but without market odds, no edge can be calculated.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | **PASS** |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate - no market |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** PASS on spread due to (1) missing hold/break percentages, and (2) no spread market available. The ranking gap (247 vs 678) and Houkes' dominance this week suggest he's a significant favorite, but without market lines, no edge can be quantified.

### Pass Conditions Met

- **CRITICAL: Hold/break data missing** - Cannot properly model game distribution
- **No totals or spread markets available** - Cannot calculate edge
- **No H2H history** - Additional uncertainty in matchup dynamics

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Visker showed TB tendency (3 TBs in recent matches), Houkes more dominant. Uncertain outcome.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** High - no data available. Cannot assess serve/return balance.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** High for totals if Houkes dominates (4 straight sets wins this week).

### Data Limitations

- **Hold/break percentages not available** for either player at any level
- **Detailed serve/return statistics missing** for ITF-level players
- **Tiebreak sample incomplete** - only Houkes career data available (49% on 79 TBs)
- **No market odds** - ITF M25 events lack totals/spread coverage

### Correlation Notes

- N/A - no positions recommended
