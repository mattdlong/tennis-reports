## Game Distribution Analysis

### Methodology

Using hold/break rates to model set outcomes:
- **Norrie expected hold vs Bonzi**: ~82.6% hold - 16.9% break faced = ~65.7% hold edge
- **Bonzi expected hold vs Norrie**: ~77.9% hold - 17.1% break faced = ~60.8% hold edge

The hold differential (Norrie +4.7%) combined with slightly higher break rate suggests Norrie should control most sets with 1-2 breaks advantage.

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Bonzi wins) | P(Norrie wins) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 1% | 5% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 5% | 22% |
| 6-4 | 8% | 20% |
| 7-5 | 6% | 12% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 8% | 13% |
| **Total Set Win** | **28%** | **72%** |

### Match Structure (Best of 5)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Norrie 3-0) | 37% |
| P(Norrie 3-1) | 35% |

| P(Bonzi 3-2) | 9% |
| **P(At Least 1 TB)** | 35% |

| Norrie 3-0 | 37% | ~28 games |
| Norrie 3-1 | 35% | ~38 games |
| Norrie 3-2 | 10% | ~46 games |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 35.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 29 - 43 |
| **Fair Line** | 35.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 36.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 36.5)** | 43% |
| **P(Under 36.5)** | 57% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Norrie's 82.6% hold rate is solid but not elite; Bonzi's 77.9% is below average. This differential suggests more break opportunities for Norrie, leading to potentially shorter sets (6-3, 6-4 type scores rather than tiebreaks).

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Moderate (~35% for at least 1 TB). Neither player is a serve-dominant "serve-bot" type, reducing tiebreak frequency. This caps the upside on totals.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 37% probability of Norrie winning 3-0, which would produce only ~28 games. This is the primary driver of the under lean. Given Bonzi's injury concerns and 0-2 start, a dominant Norrie performance is plausible.

- **Bo5 Variance:** The wide CI (29-43) reflects inherent Bo5 volatility. If Bonzi competes (like his Medvedev upsets), games spike to 40+. If he fades due to fitness, could be under 30.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Norrie -5.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | Norrie -2 to Norrie -12 |
| **Fair Spread** | Norrie -5.2 |

### Margin Drivers

- **Hold Differential:** Norrie holds 4.7% more often, translating to ~1 extra hold per 2 sets
- **Break Differential:** Norrie breaks 0.2% more often - marginal
- **Set Win Expectation:** Norrie expected to win ~3.4 sets on average

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Norrie Covers) | P(Bonzi Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Norrie -2.5 | 72% | 28% | +7 pp |
| Norrie -3.5 | 65% | 35% | +5 pp |
| Norrie -4.5 | 58% | 42% | +3.1 pp |
| Norrie -5.5 | 48% | 52% | -2 pp |
| Norrie -6.5 | 40% | 60% | -5 pp |

**Key Insight:** The model favors Norrie -4.5 as the optimal spread, with 58% coverage probability. At -5.5 or larger, the edge flips to Bonzi.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | 22 |
| Avg Game Margin | 4 (Bonzi favor) |
| TBs in H2H | 1 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 100% |

**H2H Details:**
- Metz Final 2024 (Indoor Hard): Bonzi won 7-6(6), 6-4
- Total Games: 22 | Game Margin: +4 Bonzi | Tiebreaks: 1

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 1 H2H match, on indoor hard (different conditions than outdoor Melbourne). Very limited predictive value. Do not overweight.

**Surface Context:** Never played on outdoor hard court. Indoor hard tends to favor servers more than outdoor hard, which may have helped Bonzi's upset win.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 36.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.75 units |

**Rationale:** Norrie's hold rate advantage and Bonzi's below-average hold rate (77.9%) suggest sets will feature breaks, not tiebreaks. With 37% straight sets probability and Bonzi coming off injury with an 0-2 start, the risk is a dominant Norrie 3-0 scoreline producing under 30 games. The moderate hold rates for both players limit tiebreak upside. However, confidence is LOW due to Bo5 variance and Bonzi's proven Slam upset potential.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Norrie -4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.1 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.75 units |

**Rationale:** Model expects Norrie to win by 5.2 games on average, making -4.5 a value play. The hold differential (+4.7% Norrie) should translate to 1-2 extra breaks per match. Norrie -4.5 covers in most 3-0 and 3-1 scorelines (combined 72% probability). However, if Bonzi finds his Slam form (Medvedev upsets), the margin compresses. LOW confidence due to Bonzi's upset ceiling.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Under** if: Line moves to 35.5 or lower (edge disappears)
- **Pass on Norrie -4.5** if: Line moves to -5.5 or larger (edge flips to Bonzi)
- **Pass entirely** if: Bonzi withdrawal/injury news (market will adjust)
- **Reconsider** if: Strong evidence of Bonzi's fitness issues pre-match

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If TB frequency exceeds 35% expectation (e.g., both players serving better than stats suggest), totals spike. Bonzi has shown clutch TB ability.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Bonzi's 77.9% is based on 52-week data including injury period. Actual rate could be lower (bad for spread) or higher (bad for under).

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 37% 3-0 probability is model assumption. Could be higher if Bonzi's fitness fails, or lower if he finds competitive form.

- **Bo5 Format:** Best of 5 introduces significant variance. Wide CI (29-43 games) reflects this uncertainty.

### Data Limitations

- **Missing Market Lines:** Actual totals and spread lines not found. All comparisons use estimated market lines.
- **Limited H2H:** Only 1 prior meeting (indoor hard) - not predictive for outdoor Melbourne.
- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Bonzi's TB data is clustered around 2 matches vs Medvedev - small sample.
- **Injury Uncertainty:** Bonzi's adductor injury status unclear. "Recovering" could mean anything.

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Weak positive correlation. A dominant Norrie 3-0 helps both under and Norrie -4.5. A competitive 5-setter hurts both.
- **Do not max both positions:** Combined exposure should not exceed 1.5 units given correlation.
