## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold/break modeling:
- Gibson Hold: ~70%, Blinkova Break: ~39%
- Blinkova Hold: ~57.5%, Gibson Break: ~33%

| Set Score | P(Gibson wins) | P(Blinkova wins) |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 5% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 10% | 18% |
| 6-4 | 14% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 10% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 7% | 8% |

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 45% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 55% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 28% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 8% |

**Analysis:**
- Blinkova's low hold % (57.5%) combined with Gibson's moderate break ability (33%) suggests multiple breaks per set
- Higher probability of breaks means fewer tiebreaks expected
- Expert consensus predicts 3 sets - implies competitive match despite straight sets being slightly favored

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| <=18 games | 12% | 12% |
| 19-20 | 25% | 37% |
| 21-22 | 28% | 65% |
| 23-24 | 20% | 85% |
| 25-26 | 10% | 95% |
| 27+ | 5% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 18 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.8 |
| **Market Line** | Not Available |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | ~48% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | ~52% |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | ~42% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | ~58% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have below-average hold rates (Gibson ~70%, Blinkova 57.5%). This typically leads to more breaks and shorter sets, pulling the total DOWN.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With lower hold rates, tiebreak probability is reduced (~28% for at least one TB). Fewer tiebreaks = lower total expectation.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 45% chance of straight sets. If Blinkova dominates (she's the favorite), expect 6-3, 6-3 type scorelines (18 games). This is a meaningful downside risk to totals.

- **Three-Set Probability:** 55% chance of three sets increases total, but the quality of hold% suggests three-setters would be around 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 range (24 games) rather than tiebreak-heavy.

**Conclusion:** Model leans slightly Under on typical 21.5 line, but edge is marginal (~2.1 pp). Without confirmed market lines, cannot verify edge meets 2.5% threshold.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Blinkova -3.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -8 to +2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Blinkova -3.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Blinkova Covers) | P(Gibson Covers) | Edge (est.) |
|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Blinkova -2.5 | 58% | 42% | TBD |
| Blinkova -3.5 | 48% | 52% | TBD |
| Blinkova -4.5 | 38% | 62% | TBD |
| Blinkova -5.5 | 28% | 72% | TBD |

**Analysis:**
- Model suggests Blinkova wins by ~3 games on average
- Wide confidence interval (-8 to +2) reflects high variance
- Gibson's home wildcard status and recent competitive showing vs Yastremska suggests upset potential
- Without market lines, cannot calculate precise edge

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | ~2.1 pp (below threshold) |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model suggests fair line around 20.8 games with a lean toward Under on typical 21.5 line. However, without confirmed market lines, we cannot verify edge meets 2.5% minimum. Gibson's sample-based hold/break estimates add uncertainty. Both players' poor early-2026 form creates additional variance. PASS recommended until market lines available.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | ~1.8 pp (below threshold) |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model expects Blinkova to win by ~3 games, but wide confidence interval (-8 to +2) reflects high variance in this matchup. Gibson's wildcard home advantage and competitive recent results create upset scenarios. Without market lines and given data limitations on Gibson's WTA-level hold/break, edge does not meet 2.5% threshold. PASS recommended.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** PASS - Market lines unavailable, edge estimate below 2.5%, Gibson hold/break data is sample-based
- **Spread:** PASS - Market lines unavailable, wide variance, insufficient edge
- **If lines become available:** Re-evaluate if O/U 21.5 or Blinkova -3.5 are offered at +100 or better

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** ~28% chance of at least one TB. Each TB adds 3+ games, swinging total significantly.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Gibson's hold % (~70%) is estimated from limited samples. Actual could be 65-75%.
- **Three-Set Probability:** 55% chance extends match but also increases variance on exact game count.
- **Motivation/Home Crowd:** Gibson as Australian wildcard at AO may overperform expectations.

### Data Limitations

- **Gibson WTA Hold/Break:** Limited main-draw data; estimates based on Challenger/ITF performance which may not translate
- **Tiebreak Sample (Gibson):** Career 62% but mostly from lower-level events
- **No Market Lines:** Cannot calculate precise edge without totals/spread odds
- **Recent Form:** Both 0-2 in 2026 - unclear if slump or noise

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread positions would be correlated (3-set scenario increases both total and reduces margin certainty)
- No other positions held on this match
