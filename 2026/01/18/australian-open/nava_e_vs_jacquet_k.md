## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 38.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 33 - 44 |
| **Fair Line** | 38.5 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 39.5 |
| **P(Over 39.5)** | 44% |
| **P(Under 39.5)** | 56% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Nava's 80.8% hold rate and weak 14.2% break rate means he won't create many breaks. Jacquet's ~72% hold is lower, so Nava should get some break opportunities, but his poor return game limits conversion.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** ~35% chance of at least one tiebreak given Nava's serve dominance. Each TB adds 5+ games to total, but Nava's elite TB record (4-0) means these could be decisive rather than match-extending.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 25% probability of 3-0 result caps total. Both players have strong "under" historical trends (Nava under 20.5 in 13 straight Bo5, Jacquet under 39.5 in 19/20 Bo5).

- **Best-of-5 Inexperience:** Both have limited Grand Slam experience. First-round nerves could lead to unforced errors and quicker sets.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Nava -1.5 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to +4 |
| **Fair Spread** | Nava -1.5 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Nava Covers) | P(Jacquet Covers) | Edge |
|------|----------------|-------------------|------|
| Nava -2.5 | 47% | 53% | +3.0 pp (Jacquet) |
| Nava -3.5 | 42% | 58% | +8.0 pp (Jacquet) |
| Nava -4.5 | 37% | 63% | +13.0 pp (Jacquet) |
| Nava -5.5 | 32% | 68% | +18.0 pp (Jacquet) |

**Analysis:** Market has Nava -2.5 at 53% to cover. Model suggests fair line is closer to Nava -1.5, making Jacquet +2.5 a value play. Jacquet's strong break point conversion (43%) and recent form (7-3 in last 10) support the underdog covering.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 39.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 6.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have strong historical "under" trends in best-of-5 matches. Nava's elite serve (80.8% hold) combined with weak return game (14.2% break rate) creates fewer total break opportunities. Model expects 38.5 total games, a full game below the market line. Jacquet's 19/20 under 39.5 in recent Bo5 adds confidence.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Jacquet +2.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model fair spread is Nava -1.5, not -2.5. Jacquet's 43% break point conversion rate can exploit Nava's weaker second serve points won (49.5%). H2H shows Jacquet winning by +3 games last meeting. At +2.5, Jacquet needs only to keep it competitive, which his return game supports.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on totals if:** Line moves to 38.5 or lower
- **Pass on spread if:** Line moves to Nava -1.5 or lower
- **General pass:** Any injury news affecting either player's mobility/stamina

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** If match produces 2+ tiebreaks, total could exceed 44 games easily. Nava's big serve creates TB potential.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Jacquet's hold % is estimated (~72%) rather than confirmed. Actual rate could be higher, reducing breaks.
- **Best-of-5 Experience:** Both have limited Grand Slam experience. Physical fatigue in sets 4-5 could create more breaks and variance.

### Data Limitations

- Jacquet's exact hold percentage not available (estimated from serve stats)
- Tiebreak-specific data limited for Jacquet
- Small H2H sample (1 match only)
- Both players' Bo5 historical totals based on limited Grand Slam appearances

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread positions are negatively correlated (under + Jacquet cover = competitive, low-scoring match)
- Combined position risk is moderate - if match becomes a blowout, under hits but Jacquet may not cover
- Recommend taking both positions at reduced individual stakes
