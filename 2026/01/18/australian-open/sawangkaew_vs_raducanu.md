## Game Distribution Analysis

### Key Assumptions

**Adjusted Hold/Break Rates for This Match:**

| Player | Adj. Hold % | Adj. Break % | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Sawangkaew | 58-62% | 30-35% | Downgrade from ITF to WTA competition level |
| Raducanu | 65-68% | 36-40% | Slight upgrade vs lower-ranked opponent |

The critical adjustment is Sawangkaew's break rate: her 61.1% career figure is against weaker ITF/Challenger opponents. Against WTA main draw competition (Raducanu), expect significant regression to ~32%.

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Raducanu wins) | P(Sawangkaew wins) |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 12% | 2% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 32% | 8% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 10% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 5% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 3% |

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0 Raducanu) | 58% |
| P(Straight Sets 2-0 Sawangkaew) | 12% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 30% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 15% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 3% |

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 20% | 20% |
| 19-20 | 28% | 48% |
| 21-22 | 25% | 73% |
| 23-24 | 15% | 88% |
| 25+ | 12% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 20.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | 52% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | 48% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (58-68% range). This suggests competitive service games with regular breaks, pushing toward middle-range totals.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low TB probability (~15% for at least 1 TB) due to moderate hold rates. This caps upside total variance.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 70% probability of straight sets (either direction) keeps expected total lower. However, Raducanu's inconsistent form (loss to #204 Preston) and Sawangkaew's momentum could push to 3 sets.

- **Nerves Factor:** First Grand Slam main draw for Sawangkaew could create hold volatility either direction (tight serving or inspired play).

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Raducanu -4.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -9 |
| **Fair Spread** | Raducanu -4.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Raducanu Covers) | P(Sawangkaew Covers) | Edge |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|------|
| Raducanu -2.5 | 68% | 32% | - |
| Raducanu -3.5 | 60% | 40% | - |
| Raducanu -4.5 | 52% | 48% | 1.5 pp |
| Raducanu -5.5 | 44% | 56% | - |

The -4.5 line is close to fair value. Expert consensus ("Raducanu to win at least 12 games") suggests confidence in her winning comfortably, but variance from 3-set scenarios or potential Sawangkaew upset performance creates wide confidence intervals.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 20.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.95 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.5 units |

**Rationale:** Model expects 20.8 total games with 52% probability of going over 20.5. The edge (2.8 pp) narrowly exceeds the 2.5% threshold. Sawangkaew's momentum from winning ITF W75 without dropping a set and Raducanu's inconsistent form (recent loss to #204) create potential for extended sets. However, confidence is LOW due to: (1) estimated market line, (2) Sawangkaew's untested WTA hold/break rates, and (3) Grand Slam debut nerves.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | - |
| **Edge** | 1.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model fair spread of -4.8 is close to estimated market (-4.5). Edge of 1.5 pp falls below 2.5% threshold. Wide confidence interval (-1 to -9) reflects high uncertainty: Sawangkaew could compete closely or Raducanu could dominate if she finds form. Pass on spread.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Market line moves to 21.5+ (eliminates edge)
- **Pass on Spread:** Already passing due to insufficient edge
- **Reconsider if:** Actual market lines become available and differ significantly from estimates

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Low expected TB rate (15%), but if TBs occur, adds 2-3 games per TB
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Sawangkaew's WTA-level hold rate is unknown; ITF data may not translate
- **Straight Sets Risk:** 70% straight sets probability caps total. Three-setter would push over significantly

### Data Limitations

- **No Direct Market Lines:** Totals and spread lines estimated; actual lines may differ
- **Sawangkaew ITF Data:** 63.7% hold and 61.1% break based largely on ITF/Challenger - adjusted down for WTA
- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Sawangkaew only 5 TBs played (small sample warning)
- **Missing Avg Games Data:** No direct "average total games per match" statistic available

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread are weakly correlated: Over scenarios could come from close 3-setters (hurts Raducanu spread coverage) or extended 2-setters
- No other positions flagged on this match
