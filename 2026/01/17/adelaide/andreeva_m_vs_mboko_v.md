| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 2% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 22% | 8% |
| 6-4 | 15% | 10% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 7% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 10% | 10% |

*Model assumptions: Andreeva hold 74%, break 40%; Mboko hold 70%, break 35%*

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 19 - 27 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 20.5 |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | 68% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | 32% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (70-74%), suggesting competitive games with break opportunities. This points toward 9-10 games per set, not the 7-8 of blowouts.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** ~28% chance of at least one tiebreak adds 1-2 games to expected total when it occurs.

- **Three-Set Likelihood:** 52% chance of three sets is the major driver. Mboko has played 3 three-setters this week and has shown ability to extend matches against quality opponents.

- **Contrasting Tournament Paths:** Andreeva's dominance (14.7 avg games) vs Mboko's battles (25.0 avg games) creates uncertainty, but finals tend toward the competitive middle.

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 0 |
| Avg Total Games in H2H | N/A |
| Avg Game Margin | N/A |

**First career meeting.** Players have known each other since age 12 but never met on tour. No H2H data to inform game distribution. This uncertainty favors taking a wider spread cushion.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 20.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.80 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** The 20.5 line is set too low given the 52% probability of a three-set match. Mboko's tournament path (three 3-setters averaging 28.3 games) suggests she can push sets long even against superior opponents. Andreeva's elite return game will create breaks, but Mboko's serve power (6.7 aces/match) provides holding ability that extends games.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Mboko +3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Mboko has covered +3.5 in her last 13 matches. Her clutch ability (saving match points twice this week) and willingness to battle suggests she won't be blown out. The model's fair spread of Andreeva -2.4 makes the market line of -3.5 unfavorable for the favorite. Even in a straight-sets loss, scores like 6-4, 6-4 (Mboko +4) or 6-3, 7-5 (Mboko +1) keep Mboko inside the spread.

### Pass Conditions

- **Pass on Totals if:** Line moves to 22.5+ (edge erodes below 2.5%)
- **Pass on Spread if:** Line moves to Andreeva -2.5 or tighter
- **Market Conditions:** Monitor if Andreeva odds shorten significantly (potential signal of Mboko issues)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Each tiebreak adds 1-2 games. If no TBs occur and match goes straight sets 6-3, 6-3, total is only 18 (Under).
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Mboko's hold rate is estimated from limited data (17 charted matches). Actual hold could be 65% (more breaks, lower total) or 75% (fewer breaks, higher total).
- **Dominance Risk:** If Andreeva replicates her 6-3, 6-2 week, total hits ~17-18 games and Under cashes. However, final pressure typically produces tighter play.

### Data Limitations

- **No H2H data** - First meeting creates projection uncertainty
- **Mboko sample size** - Only 17 charted matches vs Andreeva's 73+
- **Tiebreak data incomplete** - Exact TB win % not available for either player
- **Hold/break for Mboko** - Derived from serve won % rather than direct hold measurement

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Over and Mboko +3.5 are positively correlated (three-set match helps both)
- If playing both, reduce stake to 0.75 units each (1.5 total exposure vs 2.0)
- A blowout (6-1, 6-2) would lose both bets
