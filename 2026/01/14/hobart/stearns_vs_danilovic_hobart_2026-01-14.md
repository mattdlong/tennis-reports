## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

Based on hold rates: Stearns ~68%, Danilovic ~71.5%

| Set Score | P(Stearns wins) | P(Danilovic wins) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 3% | 4% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 12% | 15% |
| 6-4 | 14% | 16% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 9% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 9% | 10% |

**Note:** With both players holding at ~70%, we expect competitive sets with moderate tiebreak probability.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 42% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 58% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 28% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 8% |

**Reasoning:**
- Both players went to 3 sets in R1
- Expert consensus predicts 3-set match
- Evenly matched hold rates (~68-71%) suggest competitive games
- Stearns' tiebreak pedigree could extend sets

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤20 games | 18% | 18% |
| 21-22 | 24% | 42% |
| 23-24 | 26% | 68% |
| 25-26 | 18% | 86% |
| 27+ | 14% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 20 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.5 |
| **Market Line** | NOT AVAILABLE |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 52% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 48% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players hold at ~70% (moderate), suggesting competitive sets averaging 9.5-10 games. Neither is a serve-bot (85%+) nor a poor holder (65%-), so expect balanced games with occasional breaks.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** ~28% chance of at least one tiebreak. Stearns' 100% TB record (3-0) is encouraging but tiny sample. Danilovic has lost close tiebreaks recently. Each TB adds +1 to total games.

- **Three-Set Probability:** 58% chance of 3 sets based on competitive matchup and expert consensus. Third set adds ~9-10 games to total. Recent form confirms this (both went 3 sets in R1 with exactly 24 games each).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Danilovic -1.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -6 to +3 |
| **Fair Spread** | Danilovic -1.5 |

**Reasoning:**
- Danilovic moneyline favorite (1.77 vs 2.04)
- Higher Elo (1822 vs 1742) and Elo rank (46 vs 86)
- Confirmed superior hold/break profile (71.5%/31.9% vs estimated 68%/32%)
- Better hard court record career-wise (55% vs 40%)

| Danilovic -1.5 | 52% | 48% | N/A |
| Danilovic -2.5 | 46% | 54% | N/A |
| Danilovic -3.5 | 38% | 62% | N/A |
| Danilovic -4.5 | 30% | 70% | N/A |

**Note:** Without market lines, edge cannot be calculated.

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** No totals or spread betting lines were found for this match. Without market lines to compare against, we cannot calculate edge and must recommend PASS for both markets.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | UNKNOWN - No market line available |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects fair line at 22.5 games with 58% three-set probability and 28% tiebreak chance, suggesting a lean toward Over if market offers O/U 22.5 at standard juice. However, without actual betting lines to compare, we cannot identify edge or recommend a stake. If totals become available at O/U 21.5 or lower, Over would likely have edge. If lines open at 24.5+, Under may be value.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | UNKNOWN - No market line available |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** Model projects Danilovic -1.8 games based on superior hard court record and confirmed hold/break profile. However, the wide 95% CI (-6 to +3) reflects high uncertainty in game margin estimation for WTA matches. Without market spread lines, edge calculation is impossible.

### Pass Conditions

- **PASS on Totals:** No market line available; cannot calculate edge vs market
- **PASS on Spread:** No market line available; cannot calculate edge vs market
- **Revisit if:** Lines become available before match time

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Stearns' 100% TB record is based on only 3 tiebreaks - statistically meaningless. Danilovic has lost close tiebreaks suggesting she could go either way. High variance in TB outcomes.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Stearns' hold % is estimated (~68%) from break points saved data rather than directly observed. Could be higher or lower.

- **Three-Set Probability:** Both R1 matches went 3 sets with 24 games, but regression to mean is possible. A straight sets blowout would significantly reduce total.

### Data Limitations

- **Stearns hold % not directly available** - estimated from BP saved (58%) and BP conversion (51.1%)
- **Tiebreak sample sizes tiny** - Stearns 3 TBs, Danilovic unknown total
- **No head-to-head data** - first meeting
- **No totals/spread betting lines found** - critical gap for edge calculation

### Correlation Notes

- Totals and spread positions are partially correlated: a Danilovic blowout (covering large spread) typically means fewer total games
- If betting both markets (when lines available), size positions accounting for this correlation

## Final Notes

This match profiles as a competitive WTA 250 second-round encounter between two evenly-matched players ranked 67-68. Both went three sets in R1 with identical 24-game totals, and expert consensus expects another three-setter.

**The model suggests:**
- Fair totals line: 22.5 games (lean Over if line below)
- Fair spread: Danilovic -1.5 games

**However, without betting lines for totals or spreads, this analysis cannot produce actionable recommendations.** Both markets receive PASS ratings due to inability to calculate edge against market offerings.

If lines become available, revisit with:
- Over lean if totals line is 21.5 or below
- Danilovic spread lean only if getting -2.5 or smaller
