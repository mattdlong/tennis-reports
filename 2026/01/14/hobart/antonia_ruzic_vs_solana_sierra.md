## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Ruzic wins) | P(Sierra wins) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 28% | 12% |
| 6-4 | 18% | 14% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 6% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 6% | 5% |

**Methodology:** Based on Ruzic 66.7% hold / 44.4% break vs Sierra ~57% hold / 43.8% break

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 58% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 42% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | ~18% |
| P(2+ TBs) | ~5% |

**Rationale:**
- Both players have moderate hold rates (65-67% and ~57%), suggesting breaks will occur
- Lower hold rates → fewer tiebreaks expected
- Ruzic's hold advantage (~10pp) favors straight sets scenario

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 15% | 15% |
| 19-20 | 25% | 40% |
| 21-22 | 22% | 62% |
| 23-24 | 18% | 80% |
| 25-26 | 12% | 92% |
| 27+ | 8% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 21.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 18 - 24 |
| **Fair Line** | 21.2 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 47% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 53% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have sub-70% hold rates. Ruzic at 66.7% and Sierra estimated at ~57%. This creates a break-heavy match environment with shorter games per set (8-9 games rather than 10-11). Lower totals expected.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** With moderate-to-low hold rates, tiebreak probability is reduced (~18%). This is a totals-lowering factor. Fewer 7-6 sets expected.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 58% probability of straight sets (2-0 Ruzic). If Ruzic wins in straight sets with typical scorelines like 6-3, 6-2 or 6-4, 6-3, total would be 17-19 games. This is the most likely scenario.

- **H2H Context:** Previous meeting ended 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 (17 total games). Even with 3 sets, the total was low due to dominant sets.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Ruzic -4.2 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -1 to -8 |
| **Fair Spread** | Ruzic -4.2 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Ruzic Covers) | P(Sierra Covers) | Edge |
|------|-----------------|------------------|------|
| Ruzic -2.5 | 68% | 32% | - |
| Ruzic -3.5 | 58% | 42% | 2.8 pp |
| Ruzic -4.5 | 48% | 52% | - |
| Ruzic -5.5 | 38% | 62% | - |

**Analysis:**
- Model fair spread of -4.2 suggests Ruzic -3.5 has value
- At -3.5, Ruzic needs to win by 4+ games (e.g., 6-3, 6-2 = +7 margin)
- Straight sets scenarios mostly cover -3.5
- Three-set scenarios may not cover (depends on set scores)

## Head-to-Head (Game Context)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total H2H Matches | 1 |
| Result | Ruzic won |
| Score | 6-2, 2-6, 6-1 |
| Total Games | 17 |
| Game Margin | Ruzic +5 |
| TBs in H2H | 0 |
| 3-Setters in H2H | 100% |

**Sample Size Warning:** Only 1 previous meeting - insufficient for reliable H2H patterns. Use with caution.

**Key H2H Insight:** Despite going 3 sets, total was only 17 games due to two lopsided sets (6-2, 6-1). This supports the "low total" thesis when one player dominates.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players exhibit sub-70% hold rates, creating a break-heavy environment that shortens sets. The 58% straight sets probability combined with dominant set score expectations (6-3, 6-2 type outcomes) projects a fair line around 21.2 games. The previous H2H had only 17 games despite going 3 sets. Under 21.5 at standard prices offers ~3.2pp edge.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Ruzic -3.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Ruzic holds a ~10pp hold rate advantage (66.7% vs ~57% estimated for Sierra) and showed dominant form in R1 (7-5, 6-1). The model projects a -4.2 game margin, making -3.5 a value line. In straight sets scenarios, Ruzic should comfortably cover. The H2H supports this with Ruzic winning by +5 margin despite losing the middle set.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass if line moves to O/U 20.5 or lower (removes edge)
- **Spread:** Pass if line moves to Ruzic -4.5 or higher (edge eliminated)
- **General:** Pass if either player shows injury/fitness concerns pre-match

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** TB data unavailable for both players. If actual TB rates are higher than estimated 18%, totals could exceed expectations.
- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Sierra's hold% is estimated (~57%) from opponent break rates. If she holds better than estimated, game counts increase.
- **Three-Set Risk:** 42% probability of 3 sets. If match goes 3 sets with competitive set scores (7-5, 4-6, 7-6), could push over 23 games.

### Data Limitations

- **Sierra Hold % Missing:** Estimated from opponent break patterns - moderate confidence
- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Zero TB data available for either player - using WTA averages
- **Limited Recent Data for Sierra:** Only 3 recent matches with full game data

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals/Spread Correlation:** Under + Ruzic -3.5 have positive correlation (both favor Ruzic dominance). If taking both, consider reduced combined stake (1.5 units max vs 2.0 units).
- **Match Result Dependency:** Both plays lose value if match goes to competitive 3 sets
