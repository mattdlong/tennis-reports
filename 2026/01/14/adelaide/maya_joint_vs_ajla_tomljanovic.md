## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Joint wins) | P(Tomljanovic wins) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 4% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 18% | 16% |
| 6-4 | 16% | 15% |
| 7-5 | 10% | 9% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 10% | 9% |

**Notes:** Similar hold rates (~64%) result in balanced set score probabilities. Neither player dominant enough for frequent bagels/breadsticks.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 52% |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 48% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 38% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 12% |

**Analysis:** High three-set probability (48%) driven by similar hold/break profiles. Elevated tiebreak probability based on both players' exceptional 2025 TB records (Joint 89%, Tomljanovic 90%).

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 8% | 8% |
| 19-20 | 14% | 22% |
| 21-22 | 24% | 46% |
| 23-24 | 22% | 68% |
| 25-26 | 17% | 85% |
| 27+ | 15% | 100% |

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 22.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 19 - 27 |
| **Fair Line** | 22.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 21.5 |
| **P(Over 21.5)** | 55.3% |
| **P(Under 21.5)** | 44.7% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have nearly identical hold rates (~64%), suggesting competitive service games with regular break opportunities. This profile leads to longer sets with multiple break exchanges rather than quick holds.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** HIGH variance driver. Both players rank among the best TB performers in 2025 (Joint 89%, Tomljanovic 90% win rate). The 38% probability of at least one TB adds 0.5-1 game to expected total when it occurs.

- **Three-Set Probability:** At 48%, there's significant chance of a third set which dramatically increases total. The only completed hard court H2H match went to 3 sets (28 games at Ningbo).

- **Straight Sets Risk:** If one player dominates (52% probability), total could fall to 18-20 games. However, similar profiles make blowout unlikely.

## Market Comparison

### Totals

| Source | Line | Over | Under | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
| Model | 22.8 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Betwinner | O/U 21.5 | 55.9% | 53.5% | 9.4% | +4.2 pp Over |
| No-Vig | O/U 21.5 | 51.1% | 48.9% | 0% | +4.2 pp Over |

**Calculation:**
- Model P(Over 21.5) = 55.3%
- No-Vig Market P(Over 21.5) = 51.1%
- Edge = 55.3% - 51.1% = **4.2 pp**

### Game Spread

| Source | Line | Fav | Dog | Vig | Edge |
|--------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Model | Joint -1.8 | 50% | 50% | 0% | - |
| Market Est. | Joint -2.5 | ~54% | ~46% | ~5% | +3.1 pp Tom |

**Calculation:**
- Model P(Tomljanovic +2.5 covers) = 57%
- Estimated No-Vig Market = ~54%
- Edge = 57% - 54% = **~3.1 pp**

**Note:** Specific spread odds not available; edge estimate based on -2.5 line.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Over 21.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.2 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Both players have similar hold rates (~64%), creating competitive service games with regular break exchanges. The 48% three-set probability and 38% tiebreak probability both push expected total above the market line. The only completed hard court H2H match went to 28 games (3 sets), supporting the over.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Tomljanovic +2.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.1 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** Model suggests fair spread of Joint -1.8, making market line of -2.5 slightly too wide. Tomljanovic leads H2H 2-1 including 1-0 on hard courts, has superior experience (32 vs 19 years old), exceptional tiebreak conversion (90% in 2025), and 74% deciding set win rate. These factors suggest she can keep the match competitive even if she doesn't win outright.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on Over if line moves to 22.5 or higher
- Pass on Tomljanovic +2.5 if line moves to +3.5 or wider (already priced in)
- Pass on Joint -2.5 (insufficient edge on favorite side)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Both players are elite TB performers (89-90% win rate in 2025). While this suggests TBs are likely when sets are close, the outcome is a coin flip when it happens. High TB probability adds uncertainty to both totals and margin.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Both players' hold rates cluster around 64%, but there's 3-4% uncertainty in these estimates. A 2-3% swing in actual hold rates could shift expected total by 1-2 games.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Joint's ranking advantage materializes (she's #32 vs #76), could see a dominant 6-3, 6-4 type result (19 games), putting the under in play.

### Data Limitations

- **Hard Court H2H:** Only 1 completed match on hard courts (Ningbo 2025, 28 games, 3 sets)
- **Joint's 2026 Form:** Only 1-2 on hard courts in 2026 (though illness-affected)
- **Spread Odds:** Specific game handicap odds not available for precise edge calculation

### Correlation Notes

- **Totals and Spread:** Moderately correlated. Three-set scenarios favor both Over and tighter margin (helping Tomljanovic cover). Straight sets scenarios could hurt both plays.
- **Combined Exposure:** If betting both, recommend 1.0 units each (2.0 total) rather than full stakes on both given correlation.
