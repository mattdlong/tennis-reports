| **H2H Record** | 1-1 |
| **Surface** | Both on hard court |
| **Avg Total Games** | 20.5 |

| Date | Tournament | Winner | Score | Games | Margin |

## Game Distribution Analysis

### Hold/Break Model Inputs

| Player | Hold % | Break % | Expected Games on Serve/Set |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------------------|
| Shnaider | 69.3% | 29.6% | ~4.8 games |
| Siniakova | 54.0% | 44.0% | ~4.2 games |

**Key Insight:** Siniakova's low hold rate (54%) combined with Shnaider's 29.6% break rate means approximately 0.75-1.0 breaks per set expected on Siniakova's serve. This suggests games will flow quickly when Shnaider is returning.

### Set Score Probabilities (Modeled)

| Score | P(Shnaider wins) | P(Siniakova wins) |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 8% | 3% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 22% | 12% |
| 6-4 | 15% | 14% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 7% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 7% | 4% |

### Match Structure Probabilities

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| **Straight Sets (2-0)** | 45% |
| **Three Sets (2-1)** | 55% |
| **P(At least 1 TB)** | 18% |
| **P(2+ TBs)** | 4% |

**Note:** Lower tiebreak probability than typical WTA due to both players' moderate-to-low hold rates. Breaks likely to decide sets before 6-6.

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability |
|-------|-------------|
| ≤18 games | 12% |
| 19-20 | 18% |
| 21-22 | 25% |
| 23-24 | 22% |
| 25-26 | 13% |
| 27+ | 10% |

**Model Output:**
- **Expected Total Games: 21.5** (95% CI: 17-26)
- Mode: 21 games
- Variance driven by three-set probability and tiebreak outcomes

## Totals Analysis

### Expected Total Calculation

| Component | Value | Impact on Total |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| P(Straight Sets) | 45% | Lower total (~18-19 avg) |
| P(Three Sets) | 55% | Higher total (~23-25 avg) |
| P(At least 1 TB) | 18% | +2-3 games when occurs |
| Expected per-set games | ~9.5 | Based on hold/break |

**Model Fair Line: 21.5 games (95% CI: 17-26)**

### Totals Drivers

**Factors Pushing Under:**
- Siniakova's low hold rate (54%) → more breaks, shorter games
- Both players showed blowout capability (6-0, 6-1 sets in recent matches)
- Straight sets 45% probability
- Previous H2H averaged only 20.5 games

**Factors Pushing Over:**
- 55% three-set probability
- H2H volatility suggests momentum swings (extends matches)
- Shnaider's recent fatigue may lead to looser sets
- Both players competitive on hard court

### Market Comparison

## Handicap Analysis

### Expected Game Margin

Based on:
- Expert consensus: Shnaider ~60-64% win probability
- H2H: 1-1, average margin ~3.5 games
- Hold/break differential favoring Shnaider

**Model Fair Spread: Shnaider -2.5 games (95% CI: -7 to +3)**

### Spread Coverage Probabilities (Estimated)

| Line | P(Shnaider Covers) | P(Siniakova Covers) |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Shnaider -2.5 | 52% | 48% |
| Shnaider -3.5 | 45% | 55% |
| Shnaider -4.5 | 38% | 62% |
| Shnaider -5.5 | 32% | 68% |

**Key Insight:** Shnaider's edge is narrow. The straight sets probability (45%) helps her cover, but three-setters typically produce tighter margins due to momentum swings.

### Market Comparison

| Source | Line | Favorite | Underdog | Edge |

## Recommendations

### TOTALS

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Model Fair Line** | 21.5 |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate (no market line) |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No totals market line was available for comparison. Model suggests fair line around 21.5 games with significant variance (17-26 range). If market opens at O/U 21.5:
- Under 21.5 lean if odds > -105 (based on Siniakova's low hold rate and blowout potential)
- Monitor for three-set indicators before Over play

### GAME SPREAD

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Model Fair Line** | Shnaider -2.5 |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Edge** | Cannot calculate (no market line) |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** No spread market line available. Model suggests Shnaider -2.5 as fair line with high variance. If market opens:
- Shnaider -2.5 or better could be playable at -105 or better
- Siniakova +4.5 or better attractive given H2H competitiveness

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers
- **H2H Volatility:** Previous meeting had 0-6 and 6-0 sets - extreme swings possible
- **Siniakova's hold rate instability:** 54% hold suggests multi-break sets likely
- **Shnaider fatigue:** 3-hour triple-TB loss to Keys may impact stamina
- **Qualifier form:** Siniakova playing well after 3 qualifying wins

### Data Limitations
- **No market lines:** Cannot calculate edge without totals/spread odds
- **Small H2H sample:** Only 2 previous meetings
- **2026 season just started:** Limited current form data
- **Siniakova surface-specific stats:** Harder to isolate (doubles focus)

### Correlation Warning
If taking both totals and spread positions, note:
- Under + Shnaider cover often correlate (straight sets scenario)
- Over + Siniakova cover often correlate (three sets, close match)
