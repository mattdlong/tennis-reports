## Game Distribution Analysis

### Set Score Probabilities

| Set Score | P(Vavassori wins) | P(Diallo wins) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 6-0, 6-1 | 2% | 12% |
| 6-2, 6-3 | 8% | 28% |
| 6-4 | 12% | 18% |
| 7-5 | 8% | 7% |
| 7-6 (TB) | 5% | 5% |

**Methodology:** Based on Vavassori estimated hold ~78% vs Diallo's 82.8% hold, with Vavassori's 22% break rate vs Diallo's 20.3% break rate. Diallo's serve advantage is partially offset by Vavassori's slightly better return game.

### Match Structure

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| P(Straight Sets 2-0) | 58% (Diallo 55%, Vavassori 3%) |
| P(Three Sets 2-1) | 42% |
| P(At Least 1 TB) | 18% |
| P(2+ TBs) | 4% |

### Total Games Distribution

| Range | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| ≤18 games | 15% | 15% |
| 19-20 | 22% | 37% |
| 21-22 | 25% | 62% |
| 23-24 | 18% | 80% |
| 25-26 | 10% | 90% |
| 27+ | 10% | 100% |

**Analysis:** The distribution skews lower than Diallo's typical 23.28 average due to:
1. Expected dominance by Diallo (straight sets likely)
2. Vavassori's qualifying matches averaged only 19.5 games
3. Lower tiebreak probability given Diallo's poor TB record

## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 21.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 18 - 26 |
| **Fair Line** | 21.8 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 22.5 (estimated) |
| **P(Over 22.5)** | 38% |
| **P(Under 22.5)** | 62% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Diallo's 82.8% hold vs Vavassori's estimated 78% suggests moderate service dominance. The gap isn't huge, but Diallo's superior ranking and serve power should create enough break opportunities to close sets decisively.

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low (~18%) for at least one TB. Diallo's poor TB conversion on hard courts (43.8%) is somewhat irrelevant as tiebreaks are unlikely with the hold differential.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** 58% chance of 2-0 finish strongly pulls total down. Vavassori's qualifying wins (17 and 22 games) suggest he can either dominate lesser players or have competitive sets.

## Handicap Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Game Margin** | Diallo -3.8 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | -8 to +2 |
| **Fair Spread** | Diallo -3.8 |

### Spread Coverage Probabilities

| Line | P(Diallo Covers) | P(Vavassori Covers) | Edge vs Market |
|------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Diallo -2.5 | 62% | 38% | N/A |
| Diallo -3.5 | 52% | 48% | N/A |
| Diallo -4.5 | 43% | 57% | +1.8 pp (est) |
| Diallo -5.5 | 35% | 65% | N/A |

**Analysis:** Fair spread at -3.8 means Diallo -4.5 would be a marginal value on Vavassori, but edge is below 2.5% threshold.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 22.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.90 or better |
| **Edge** | 2.8 pp |
| **Confidence** | LOW |
| **Stake** | 0.75 units |

**Rationale:** Diallo should be able to break Vavassori consistently given the ranking and skill differential. With 58% straight sets probability and Vavassori's qualifying average of just 19.5 games, the under has value. However, data quality is limited for Vavassori, warranting reduced confidence.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | PASS |
| **Target Price** | N/A |
| **Edge** | 1.8 pp (below threshold) |
| **Confidence** | PASS |
| **Stake** | 0 units |

**Rationale:** While Vavassori +4.5 shows marginal value (57% cover probability vs ~52% market), the 1.8 pp edge is below the 2.5% minimum threshold. The wide confidence interval (-8 to +2) reflects high uncertainty in game margin estimation.

### Pass Conditions

- **Totals:** Pass if Under 22.5 moves to Under 21.5 (edge disappears)
- **Spread:** Already a PASS at current edge
- **General:** Pass on both markets if Vavassori shows fitness issues in warmup

---

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Vavassori's hold rate is estimated from very limited ATP singles data. His doubles serve statistics may not translate to singles.
- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Diallo dominates (6-2, 6-3 type sets), total could come in well under 20. If competitive (three sets), easily goes over.
- **Vavassori Fatigue:** Back-to-back qualifying matches could impact stamina, potentially shortening match if he fades.

### Data Limitations

- **Vavassori hold/break %:** No reliable surface-specific hold/break data available; estimates based on qualifying performance
- **Tiebreak sample:** Vavassori TB statistics essentially non-existent in singles
- **Market lines:** Specific totals and spread odds not found; recommendations based on estimated lines

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Under and Vavassori spread cover are positively correlated if Diallo wins comfortably in straight sets
- If backing Under, would lean toward Diallo covering if taking spread (though spread is PASS)
