## Totals Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Expected Total Games** | 20.0 |
| **95% Confidence Interval** | 17 - 23 |
| **Fair Line** | 20.0 |
| **Market Line** | O/U 20.5 |
| **P(Over 20.5)** | 45% |
| **P(Under 20.5)** | 55% |

### Factors Driving Total

- **Hold Rate Impact:** Both players have moderate hold rates (68% and 71%), indicating frequent break opportunities. This typically leads to shorter sets (6-3, 6-4 patterns rather than tiebreaks).

- **Tiebreak Probability:** Low tiebreak likelihood (~12% for at least 1 TB) given neither player is a serve-dominant player. This caps the upside for total games.

- **Straight Sets Likelihood:** H2H history shows 100% straight sets (18.5 avg games). High straight sets probability (60%) strongly favors Under.

- **H2H Pattern:** Both previous meetings were 6-3, 6-3 and 6-3, 6-4 = 18 and 19 total games. This is the strongest Under signal.

## Recommendations

### Totals Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Total Games |
| **Selection** | Under 20.5 |
| **Target Price** | 1.85 or better |
| **Edge** | 4.5 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** H2H history shows consistent low-game-count matches (avg 18.5 games). With both players having moderate hold rates (68% and 71%) rather than serve-dominant profiles, we expect breaks rather than tiebreaks. Straight sets outcome is highly likely (60%+), and Andreeva's dominant style against Bouzkova produces efficient victories. The market line at 20.5 offers value on the Under.

### Game Spread Recommendation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Market** | Game Handicap |
| **Selection** | Bouzkova +4.5 |
| **Target Price** | 2.00 or better |
| **Edge** | 3.0 pp |
| **Confidence** | MEDIUM |
| **Stake** | 1.0 units |

**Rationale:** While Andreeva is the clear favorite and has won H2H matches by 5-6 games, the market spread at -4.5 is on the high end. Our model fair line is -5.0, meaning Bouzkova covers 53% of the time at +4.5. Bouzkova's defensive playing style and consistency should keep games competitive even in straight sets. The -4.5 line leaves little margin for error for Andreeva backers.

### Pass Conditions

- Pass on Under if line moves to 19.5 (edge drops below 2.5%)
- Pass on Bouzkova +4.5 if line moves to +3.5 (model edge disappears)
- Pass if Andreeva shows fitness concerns in warm-up (would increase variance)

## Risk & Unknowns

### Variance Drivers

- **Tiebreak Volatility:** Low TB probability (12%) reduces upside variance on totals, but if a TB occurs, adds 13 games to that set.

- **Hold Rate Uncertainty:** Stats based on last 10 matches; surface adjustment is implicit rather than explicit.

- **Straight Sets Risk:** If Andreeva dominates as in H2H (60% probability), total games will be 18-20. However, her recent Brisbane matches went 3 sets, introducing uncertainty.

### Data Limitations

- **Tiebreak Sample Size:** Insufficient TB-specific win rates for both players
- **Surface-Specific Hold/Break:** Only overall hold/break available, not hard-court specific
- **H2H Sample:** Only 2 matches (both favoring Under, but small sample)

### Correlation Notes

- Totals Under and Bouzkova +4.5 are positively correlated: if Andreeva wins quickly in straight sets with dominant margins, Under hits but Bouzkova likely misses +4.5
- If Bouzkova takes a set, both Under likely misses and +4.5 likely hits
- Consider capping combined exposure at 1.5 units total

### Fatigue Factor

- **Bouzkova** played a 2h30m match yesterday vs Badosa (3 sets)
- This could work either way: fatigue leads to quicker loss (Under/covers spreads) OR battle-tested sharpness leads to competitive 3-setter (Over/busts spreads)
